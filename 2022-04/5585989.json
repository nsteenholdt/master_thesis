Our current research focus concerns proteins involved in matrix degradation (during cancer invasion and metastasis) and in intravascular lipid metabolism. The successful candidate will be responsible for maintaining and developing our pipeline of recombinant protein production using contemporary technologies as well as performing individual research projects within the project aims of the group.<br/><br/>  <strong>Start: </strong>Preferably August 2022 or after agreement<br/><br/>  <strong>Duration:</strong> Three years<br/><br/>  <strong>Our research group</strong><br/><br/>  We are a small research group at the Finsen Laboratory and we focus on biochemical and biophysical characterization of disease relevant proteins and their ligands. We provide a detailed understanding on how a given pathway maintains homeostasis in normal physiology and why certain aberrations—such a missense mutations and natural polymorphisms—cause dysregulation in pathophysiology. Ultimately, we seek to use this information in translational pipelines - <em>e.g.</em> the clinical phase-2 trials with our uPAR-targeting peptide for non-invasive PET imaging of uPAR-expression in chronic inflammation and solid cancer (<em>Front. Cell Dev. Biol</em>. 2021, doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.732015). For review on our research in intravascular lipid metabolism (<em>Front. Cell Dev. Biol.</em> 2021, doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.702508).<br/><br/>  We offer a highly dynamic and interactive research environment with an extensive national and international research network. Our attention is strictly focused on the scientific research and we seek to launch a joint effort to advance and keep momentum in our research—thus exploiting the synergy created in that process.
