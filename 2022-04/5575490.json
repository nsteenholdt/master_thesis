We are seeking a candidate for a 3-year PhD to study how fetal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals can disrupt reproductive development. This project is particularly concerned with development of genitalia and how disrupted signaling early in life can cause reproductive diseases such as genital malformations. Genital malformations are among the most common congenital disorders in newborn babies. Up to 1 in 125 boys, are affected by defective penis development and are born with e.g. hypospadias; a displacement of the urethral opening. What molecular mechanisms are involved in hypospadias formation and how chemical exposures can contribute to this disease etiology we know little about. <br/>\n<br/>\n This project will use a variety of approaches, including in vivo rodent studies followed by molecular and histopathological characterization. It also involves systematic analysis of available literature to develop causal pathway descriptions that are relevant for chemical risk assessment. You will be part of the research group for Molecular &amp; Reproductive Toxicology at DTU Food, which is involved in both basic research and science-based advisory work for regulatory authorities. <br/>\n<br/>\n This PhD project has a strong focus on deciphering what molecular pathways are affected by chemical exposure and how this translates into disease causation in animals and humans, with an overall aim of improving testing and regulation of chemicals internationally. Specific tasks will include, but not be limited to: <ul><li>Be involved with in utero rat toxicity studies and carry out downstream analyses. </li>\n<li>Analyze histopathological changes in rat offspring with focus on reproductive systems. </li>\n<li>Conduct ex vivo organ cultures to study effects of chemical exposure to genital development. </li>\n<li>Characterize molecular pathways involved in genital development and disease etiologies. </li>\n<li>Develop Adverse Outcome Pathways for chemical risk assessment purposes. </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>Responsibilities and qualifications</b>\n<br/>\n You are expected to carry out independent research under guidance of your supervisors. Other responsibilities include: <ul><li>Complete courses required for completion of the PhD program at DTU (~30 ECTS) </li>\n<li>Write scientific papers and present your work at institutional, national and international meetings and conferences </li>\n<li>Undertake a research placement abroad for 2-4 months. </li>\n<li>Write a PhD thesis for the completion of the PhD candidature </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. <br/>\n<br/>\n Other desirable qualifications include:<br/>\n<ul><li>Strong English language skills, verbal and written. </li>\n<li>Strong communication and organizational skills </li>\n<li>Previous experience with laboratory work, e.g. cell culture, molecular techniques, and animal studies. </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU.
