Together with academic and industrial partners, we have embarked on a new project, PhotoQ, supported by Innovation Fund Denmark that aims at developing quantum computers on photonics platforms that are more easily scalable than other quantum computing platforms. Your task will be to design and develop a number of subcomponents for these platforms, on both software and hardware side. <br/>\n<br/>\n The project is hosted at the section for Quantum Physics and Information Technology (QPIT) at DTU Physics and will operate in tight connection with the DNRF Center of Excellence for Macroscopic Quantum States (bigQ). The QPIT research group comprises ~50 students, researchers and engineers from a wide range of backgrounds, and its mission is to exploit quantum phenomena such as entanglement and quantum superposition to enable quantum computing and networking, secure communication, and extreme sensing. The research profile spans all the way from pure fundamental research to applied research, and we collaborate extensively with external partners from e.g. Danish SMEs and corporations and universities abroad. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The job</b>\n<br/>\n The job involves development of a range of rather diverse subsystems: <ul><li>FPGA-based low-latency, high-speed signal processing and feed-forward </li>\n<li>FPGA-based interferometric stabilisation and multi-channel control system </li>\n<li>high-speed, low-noise photo-detectors and other analog circuit design </li>\n<li>Python-based interface for controlling all experimental parameters </li>\n<li>Python API for remote control of the experiment </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n For this reason we are looking for a 'Jack of all trades'. We cannot expect you to have experience with everything, but the more boxes you can tick, the better. The development work will be carried out in tight collaboration with the students, postdocs and professors working on the project. We have a clear idea of what we want to achieve, but not necessarily of how to do it - then it would not be research - so you will have a lot of influence on how to implement the various systems. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b> Our expectations of you We expect that you </b>\n<ul><li>have significant experience with several of the technologies involved </li>\n<li>have a keen interest in working at the interface between science and technology </li>\n<li>will be able to deliver high-quality and well documented hardware and software </li>\n<li>have an open-minded attitude towards exploring different possible solutions </li>\n<li>are able to work tightly towards a common goal in a team with people of diverse backgrounds and skill sets </li>\n<li>are willing to tutor highly skilled PhD students and postdoc </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n As this position will involve the development of quantum technology with an eye towards commercialization, the candidate should have an entrepreneurial and open-minded attitude, and be willing to collaborate with industry and end-users. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b> What we offer in return</b>\n<br/>\n We offer an interesting and challenging job in an international atmosphere with the focus on research, teaching, innovation and public sector services for the benefit of the surrounding community. We place emphasis on a high level of professionalism among our staff, so skills development is an integral part of our organization. We offer a great flexibility in the position. In the area of technical and natural sciences, DTU is one of the leading research and education institutions in Europe. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Salary and appointment terms</b>\n<br/>\n The appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. The position is a full-time position and time-limited to three years. <br/>\n<br/>\n The workplace is DTU Lyngby Campus. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Application and contact</b>\n<br/>\n Please submit your online application no later than Tuesday, 10 May 2022 (Danish time).

We are a large, highly international research group of students and staff with diverse backgrounds. We have a friendly and dynamic research environment with close, daily interaction among group members and strong collaborations with many academic and industrial partners. Technical support is excellent with electronics and process engineers embedded in the section and a large capacity, skilled mechanical workshop at the Department.
