You will be enrolled at DTU Chemical Engineering within the CHEC research center in a dynamic research environment. The project involves collaboration with Aarhus University, Copenhagen University and several industrial companies, including Alfa Laval, Equinor, Kalundborg Refinery and foremost Haldor Topsøe and will provide research with an international and practical impact. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Responsibilities and qualifications</b>\n<br/>\n Fast pyrolysis is a fairly simple and efficient way to convert solid biomass such as wood and agricultural waste to a liquid fuel in high yield. The liquid fuel however has adverse properties such as low heating value, low pH/high acidity and poor storage stability due to the high oxygen content. To obtain a high quality liquid fuel that can be used for heavy transport and aviation the oxygen must be removed by hydrotreating. A main challenge in standard hydrotreating of the pyrolysis oil is the poor thermal stability of the oil that leads to fast coking/deactivation of catalysts and plugging of the reactor. The aim of the PhD project is to develop a two-stage catalytic process that allows for continuous and un-interrupted production of oxygen-free high quality liquid hydrocarbon fuel. The intended process involves a low temperature catalytic step where the pyrolysis oil is initially stabilized by converting reactive species causing the poor stability to more stable species, followed by ordinary hydrotreating of the oil to obtain a high quality fuel. <br/>\n<br/>\n The PhD study will be involved in the following tasks: <ul><li>Perform a literature study of biomass pyrolysis oil composition, catalytic pyrolysis oil stabilization and hydrotreating. </li>\n<li>Perform experiments to screne catalysts in a high pressure batch autoclave reactor on conversion of model pyrolysis oils as well as real pyrolysis oil to identify 1) the most reactive species in the pyrolysis oil and 2) the most promising catalysts for stabilizing the oil. </li>\n<li>Take part in setting up a high pressure two-stage trickle bed reactor setup for integrated pyrolysis oil stabilization and hydrotreating. </li>\n<li>Perform experiments using the trickle bed reactor using both model pyrolysis oils and real pyrolysis oils with the aim to identify reaction conditions and catalysts that allow continuous operation. </li>\n<li>Analyze, in collaboration with the project partners, the composition of the stabilized and fully upgraded pyrolysis oil in comparison with the untreated pyrolysis oil. </li>\n<li>Interact with the other partners of the project to reach overall project goals. </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n Candidates should have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) within chemical engineering, chemistry or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. Knowledge/experiences in catalyst synthesis, testing and characterization will be an advantage. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU.
