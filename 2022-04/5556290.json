The PhD fellowship is financed by the LEO Foundation as part of the LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery (LFCCDD) to which the project is affiliated. The successful applicant will be a member of the Pharmaceutical Physical Chemistry group and will have the opportunities for cross-disciplinary research in collaboration with the other sections of the Center as well as external collaborators.<br/><br/>  The fellowship is available from 1st of September 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter.<br/><br/>  <strong>Project description</strong><br/><br/>  Topical application is a minimally invasive, attractive route of drug administration. Unfortunately, the skin constitutes a formidable barrier to drug delivery, limiting the number of substances that can be delivered. Via improved understanding of the interplay between the physical chemical forces governing membrane transport, we aim to expand the number of drugs that can be delivered effectively to the skin. We take a physical chemical approach to improving skin transport exploring a novel multiple prodrug approach. We will focus on the thermodynamic activity of the drug, prodrugs (chemical derivatives of diclofenac), and the vehicles applied, which is the driving force for transport. Basic physical chemistry dictates that the transport of a molecule is unaffected by the presence of other molecules. This opens for simultaneous administration of multiple prodrugs for increasing the “operational” thermodynamic activity and, hence, driving force of drug transport. However, high prodrug concentrations will affect solvent thermodynamic activity. Hence, the concept provides a tool for separating molecular, solvent, and membrane effects on transport. The prodrug approach will be explored via transport studies over artificial membranes and human skin pursuing conditions allowing delineation of solvent, membrane interactions, and supersaturation effects. Incorporation of multiple molecules/prodrugs in a delivery vehicle for application to skin represents a new approach, which may be exploited, e.g., in treatment of pain and inflammation or actinic keratosis.<br/><br/>  <strong>Principal supervisor</strong><br/> Professor Jesper Østergaard, Department of Pharmacy, e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:jesper.ostergaard@sund.ku.dk\">jesper.ostergaard@sund.ku.dk</a>, direct phone: +45 3533 6138<br/><br/>  <strong>Place of employment</strong><br/><br/>  The place of employment is at the Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen.
