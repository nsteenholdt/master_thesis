The successful applicants will work closely with the PI and a PhD student on the ETHOS project, but will also be expected to contribute to other relevant research projects and consultancy tasks at CFA. Teaching/supervision activities are also possible, though not required for the position.<br/><br/>The ETHOS project focuses on research integrity and responsible conduct of research and examines how integrity policies are turned into practice in academic environments. Particularly, the project seeks to combine qualitative and quantitative methods in order to understand how integrity emerges as a problem, which solutions are attached to it and how this impacts scientific practices.

The ETHOS project aims to explore how academic and public discourses shape the problem of research integrity and how such problematizations affect academic practices and perceptions. Therefore, it combines qualitative data collection and analysis (e.g. interviews and document analysis) with large-scale text analyses of scholarly literature and European policy documents (through combining qualitative coding, quantitative code, theme analysis, and natural language processing). This means that expertise within natural language processing, <em>or</em> policy analysis and/or qualitative methods could be an asset, although not demanded.<br/><br/>In addition to a CV and proof of PhD degree (or near completion of a PhD degree), interested applicants should provide a 1-2 page application letter motivating why they are interested in the position and how they think they can contribute to the specific research project, e.g. in terms of some of the methodological skills mentioned above.<br/><br/><b><br/><strong>Further information</strong></b><br/><br/>Applicants are welcome to contact Associate Professor Lise Degn (<a href=\"mailto:ld@ps.au.dk\" >ld@ps.au.dk</a>) prior to submitting their application to learn more about the positions and the ETHOS project.<br/><br/>If you need help uploading your application or have any questions about the recruitment process, please contact HR supporter Anne Arnfeldt Källberg, Tel.: +45 9352 1361, Email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:aak@au.dk\" >aak@au.dk</a><br/><br/><b><br/><strong>Place of work</strong></b><br/><br/>Danish Centre for Studies in Research and Research Policy, Department of Political Science, Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University, Bartholins Allé 7, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><br/><b><strong>International applicant? </strong></b><br/><br/><p>Aarhus University offers a broad variety of services for international researchers and accompanying families, including relocation service and career counselling to expat partners.
