The position is for 18 months, with start 1st of August 2022. <br/><br/>  The Department of Food Science at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH FOOD) strives to be internationally recognised for excellence in food research and education, with an impact for consumers, industry and society. It contributes to the production of sustainable and healthy food by:<br/><br/>  <ul> \t<li><strong>Creating</strong> the fundamental knowledge for a secure and sustainable future food supply of high quality (safe, nutritious, tasty)</li> \t<li><strong>Reducing</strong> the environmental impact of food production through research in the production of sustainable proteins and consumer preferences</li> \t<li><strong>Developing </strong>green food production systems through research in responsible and sustainable production methods and by digitalization of the food manufacturing chain</li> </ul>  The position is related to the project “Mushroom fermentation of side streams from food industry”. The purpose of the project is to convert industrial plant waste streams from sugar production into fungal mycelium (Oyster Mushroom, <em>Pleourotus Ostreatus</em>). The fungal product will subsequently be included as protein ingredient / component in foods. Here it will contribute significantly to reduce resource consumption, increase the quality of plant-based meat substitute and could help replace meat production and thus lower greenhouse gases.<br/><br/>  Further information on the Department is linked at <a href=\"http://www.science.ku.dk/english/about-the-faculty/organisation/\">http://www.science.ku.dk/english/about-the-faculty/organisation/</a>.
