into hardware and software technologies that play a vital role in defining modern society, its digitalisation and human behaviour therein. Our focus is on research and development activities in the fields of communication and networks, control and automation, photonics, signal processing, software and IT systems, robot technology, medical technology, health technology, electrical energy technology, and acoustics and sound technology.<br/><br/>Many of our research and development activities are based on the specific innovation needs or specialist application areas of specific companies. Close collaboration with the public sector and private companies ensures that the knowledge and technology generated in the department's research environments has a clear anchoring in reality and benefits society as whole. We also provide research-based public sector consultancy on technology in the agriculture and food area.<br/><br/>At the department, we educate BEng, BSc and MSc graduates in engineering for Danish society.<br/><br/>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering was established on 1 January 2021 at Faculty of Technical Sciences at Aarhus University simultaneously with three other engineering departments; Department of&nbsp;Civil and Architectural Engineering, Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering and Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering.<br/><br/>Specifically, you will be attached to the “Biomedical &amp; Pervasive Systems” research group.<br/><br/>We conduct basic and applied research within the biomedical &amp; pervasive systems research areas. Our main research area is pervasive healthcare, including ambient assisted living and telemedicine, where we focus on creating open science and open source tools and platforms for supporting healthcare research.
