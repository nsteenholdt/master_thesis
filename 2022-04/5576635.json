The position will start on 1 August 2022, or as soon as possible thereafter.<br/> <br/> <strong>Our group and research</strong><br/> The Center for Evolutionary Hologenomics was recently funded by the Danish National Research Foundation to develop and implement state of the art ‘omics and associated computational techniques, to address through experimental and theoretical research, four key themes underscoring life on earth. Specifically, these are: What is the relationship between a host’s genome, or epigenome, and the functional and taxonomic makeup of its associated microbial metagenome? Does this relationship explain ongoing ecological and evolutionary processes in the host? Could this relationship provide an alternate explanation to some of life’s big transitions? And, how have we humans exploited this relationship? The Centre is embedded within the GLOBE Institute, that is part of the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen. The Institute’s main purpose is to address basic scientific questions through interdisciplinary approaches. The institute operates at the intersection of natural sciences, medical sciences and the humanities.<br/> <br/> <strong>Project description</strong><br/> It has become clear that the gut microbiome shapes the phenotype of vertebrate hosts, with profound consequences for phenotypic traits related to growth and health. However, an often-ignored part of the gut microbiome communities relate to the virome including bacteriophages. Indeed, it has been suggested that the specific bacteriophages may play a larger role than e.g. the surrounding environment, in regulating the composition of the host associated gut microbiome community. This project will add to this knowledge gap by considering various fish model systems to better understand how phages control microbiome dynamics, and if this knowledge can ultimately be transferred into concrete applied solutions in the food production and human health sectors where there is an interest in modifying microbiomes. The project will include focus on both wild and farmed fish populations and with eye towards longer term potential of translating the results into applied phage therapy solutions. The student is expected to apply a hologenomics approach to study the role of the virome in regulating beneficial microbiome functions. This PhD fellowship will be supervised by Assoc. Prof. Morten Limborg and by Prof. Thomas Sicheritz-Pontén.<br/> <br/> <strong>Principal supervisor</strong> is<strong> </strong>Assoc.
