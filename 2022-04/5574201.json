These models are being developed as part of a larger project to evaluate the impact of agricultural strategies for stacking managements designed to support ecosystem service providers.<br/>&nbsp;The project will follow all steps of the model development from a realistic life-story, proceeding through the algorithm implementation in ALMaSS, calibration, documentation, and end with application of the models to answer the questions about the optimal strategies for supporting ecosystem service providers in&nbsp;agricultural landscapes. The main focus of these models is initially aphids but will subsequently involve working with agent-based predator models in ALMaSS.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><b><strong>Your profile</strong></b><br/><br/><br/>The candidate should have experience of insect ecology, and modelling or programming experience, to be able to support the simulation modelling developments for pest and predators in agriculture. Training in programming C++ can be provided.<br/><br/>The applicant is expected to have a PhD or equivalent in a relevant area for one of the positions described. Ability to work and communicate well as part of a team is essential. Good English skills are necessary to communicate with the largely international team.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><b><strong>Who we are</strong></b><br/><br/><br/>The Department of Ecoscience is engaged in research programmes, teaching curricula and advisory work covering the major biological sub-disciplines.

SESS develops agent-based system simulation models to predict impacts of management of landscapes, both agricultural and natural across Europe. The research team includes software engineers, ecologists, ecotoxicologists, and GIS specialists, and is distributed over a number of European countries.<br/><br/>The successful applicant will join the core Danish team, which leads the software design and development of the simulation software and its application in risk assessment and policy-related landscape management, and be responsible for scientific administration related to the centre and its research projects<br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><b><strong>What we offer </strong></b><br/><br/>&nbsp;The Department offers a vibrant and informal research environment with longstanding traditions for collaboration with elite international university partners and with the Danish Ministry of the Environment.<br/>The working environment at the Department is based on teamwork and close working relations.
