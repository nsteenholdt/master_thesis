AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of energy homeostasis and a promising drug target for treatment of metabolic disorders. We have recently identified that Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, is a downstream target of AMPK in various cells/tissues including muscle and liver. The successful candidate will conduct experiments to elucidate 1) the molecular mechanism by which AMPK regulates TFEB, and 2) investigate functional roles that AMPK-TFEB axis play in the context of cellular metabolism and adaptation using genetic and pharmacological tools in both cellular and tissue/whole-body levels.<br/><br/>  <strong>Profile </strong><br/> We are looking for highly motivated and enthusiastic researcher who have the following skills and qualifications:<br/><br/>  <ul> \t<li>PhD in Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Molecular Biomedicine, or related sciences</li> \t<li>Profound knowledge on energy metabolism, protein kinase regulation/signaling, enzymology and biochemical assays</li> \t<li>Proven track record in relation to career stage (at least one first authored publication in an internationally recognised peer-reviewed journal)</li> \t<li>Experience with preclinical studies is a plus </li> \t<li>Proficient communication skills and ability to work in multi-disciplinary teams</li> \t<li>Experience in supervising other researchers at different levels</li> \t<li>Excellent English communication skills, both written and spoken</li> </ul>  <strong>Place of employment</strong><br/> The place of employment is at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Maersk Tower, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen.
