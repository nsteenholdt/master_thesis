These are some of the questions that have motivated many AI researchers in creating machines that can mimic natural intelligence. With this PhD project, we would like to develop the foundations of a long term effort in attempting to answer the first questions, starting with human visual perception. The successful candidate will investigate how to build interpretable deep learning models of visual perception with the long-term goal of establishing deep neural networks as a tool to interpret the human brain. In particular,  given the mediating role of eye movements in the visual perception process, we will work on building models that leverage both EEG and eye-tracking using neural network architectures that can process spatio-temporal data, so that we can capture both topological and sequential patterns in the brain response.<br/><br/>  <strong>Principal supervisor: </strong>Associate Professor Paolo Burelli, Department of Digital Design, <a href=\"mailto:pabu@itu.dk\">pabu@itu.dk</a><br/><br/>  <strong>2) The replicability crisis in XR research:</strong><br/> Extended reality (XR) research continues to produce breakthroughs in interaction techniques, discover remarkable behavioral effects of acting with virtual bodies and environments, and demonstrate its ability to move traditional laboratory experiments online.

Although XR as a technological medium is exceptionally well suited for cross-lab replications, initiatives that are being implemented in other behavioral sciences, such as open source, open data, preregistration, multi-site studies, adversarial collaboration, and many others, are rarely used in XR research. The present PhD project will systematically explore the extent of the replicability crisis in XR research. The project will establish the applicability of initiatives that have improved scientific practice in other research areas, for XR research. As a result, the project will lead an international open science initiative to make both previous and future XR research more robust.<br/><br/>  <strong>Principal Supervisor</strong>: Assistant Professor, Aske Mottelson, Department of Digital Design, <a href=\"mailto:asmo@itu.dk\">asmo@itu.dk</a>.
