The project is a collaboration between several European Universities and industrial partners. The project aims at developing knowledge and tools to promote genome and epigenome- enabled methods for selection to be used in pig and chicken breeding.<br/><br/>  <strong>Our research</strong><br/><br/>  At University of Copenhagen, Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, we have a well-established group working with genetics, genomics, breeding, and bioinformatics. The overall focus of our research is to generate information that contributes to novel biological insight into mammalian genomes and clarify the function of genomic components, with the aim to support sustainable animal breeding and production and ensure animal health and welfare. Our group has a broad research network both nationally and internationally. Thus, you will be part of a dynamic and enthusiastic working environment with plenty of opportunities for your career development.<br/><br/>  <strong>Your job</strong><br/> Your work will focus on studies of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying growth, feed efficiency and lean meat content in pigs. The work will comprise sampling of phenotypic data in a large cohort of pigs.  Furthermore, you will be involved in laboratory work on DNA and RNA extraction for characterization of the pig genome, the epigenome / methylome and the transcriptome. Subsequently, you will perform integrated analyses on the obtained omics datasets. The goal of this work is to identify genetic and epigenetic determinant for the above-mentioned traits of importance for efficiency, product quality, and sustainability. The results will feed into work packages in GEroNIMO, which focus on development of innovative genomic prediction models that take advantage of individual epigenetic profiles.
