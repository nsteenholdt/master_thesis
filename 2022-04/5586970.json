This will involve estimation of variance components including both genotyped and non-genotyped individuals and optimum methods to handle genotype by environment interactions for traits recoded under different locations and weather conditions. Methods for evaluation and comparison of models should be developed and implemented in hybrid breeding schemes that involves three separate breeding populations. The position is for 2 years of employment and there are possibilities for extension up to a maximum of 4 years if the candidate is considered qualified and sufficient funding is available.<br/><br/>The position is related to collaborative project together with commercial breeding companies with the goal of developing methods and models that can be implemented in practical applications.
