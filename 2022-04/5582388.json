An important reason is that the prevention and control of foodborne infections is complicated: Most of these infections are transmitted not only through a variety of foods, but also through the environment (e.g. contaminated water), by zoonotic means (e.g. direct animal contact) and person-to-person transmission with the contribution of each transmission route and source varying across diseases, populations, geographical areas and seasons. Targeted intervention, among other things, consequently requires evidence on most important sources and transmission routes for these infections. <br/>\n<br/>\n Therefore, the research group for Foodborne Pathogens and Epidemiology seeks a candidate for a PhD position for the application of bacterial genomic data in the epidemiological modeling of foodborne pathogens for monitoring and tracking sources of foodborne infections. The main part of the work is to be carried out as part of an international project aiming to estimate the disease burden and identify the sources of foodborne infections in selected urban and rural areas in four African countries. The project outcomes will support policymakers in making data-driven decisions on prioritising control and intervention options for foodborne infections in low-resource countries. However, the candidate will also be supporting the national surveillance of foodborne infections through epidemiological modeling of WGS data. <br/>\n<br/>\n The Foodborne Pathogens and Epidemiology research group analyzes and interprets data on foodborne pathogens, and antibiotic resistance and consumption, and develops epidemiological models, monitoring strategies, interventions, decision-making tools and performs risk assessments. The research group combines methods in quantitative epidemiology with output from conventional and molecular microbiology (WGS, NGS). <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Responsibilities and qualifications</b>\n<br/>\n Your overall focus will be to support the research group's competences in applying WGS/NGS data in epidemiological modeling. <br/>\n<br/>\n Your primary tasks will be to:<br/>\n<ul><li>Analyse and interpret data on the occurrence of selected foodborne pathogens in humans, animals, food and the environment collected in four African countries with the purpose of identifying sources, transmission routes and other risk factors for foodborne infections </li>\n<li>Support the analysis and interpretation of national surveillance data on foodborne pathogens </li>\n<li>Communicate research results by presenting data at project meetings and international conferences, and write reports and manuscripts for publication </li>\n<li>Collaborate with internal and external partners through active participation in national and international meetings and conferences, sharing of data and results, and contribution to joint publications </li>\n<li>Participate in the teaching of the research group's courses </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n The day-to-day work will be performed in close collaboration with other researchers in the Foodborne Pathogens and Epidemiology group and within the project consortium. <br/>\n<br/>\n You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. <br/>\n<br/>\n You must have competences in analysing genomic data e.g. through your Master education and/or Master thesis, as well as basic skills in modelling using statistical software such as R®. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU.
