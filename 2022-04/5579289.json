As the ever-increasing desire for fast and reliable internet is quickly becoming a necessity, so is the need for efficient and performant ways of achieving it. Teledriving, video calls, online multiplayer gaming, cloud streaming, satellite or underwater communication, and many other uses are dependent on ultra-low latency and highly reliable connectivity to be viable. These are just some of the exciting use cases for our technology, every day we find new applications where we can make networks smarter and experiences more seamless.</p>\n<p>Steinwurf was founded in 2011 by an international team of researchers. We specialize in innovating and developing smart network technologies by reaping the benefits of our high-performance erasure correcting codes. Steinwurf today provides patented algorithms for e.g. low latency communication, reliable multicast, and distribution of large files, which are sold as off-the-shelf software components to companies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Zry4VIyliHk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rely Demonstration [YouTube]</a>&nbsp; (0:31)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/fAVZfMrpFgg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fixing choppy and bad resolution video calls in Slack [YouTube]</a> (5:46)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What your day would look like<br /><br /></strong>We&rsquo;re looking for a software developer with experience in creating and maintaining native applications.

While our technology is primarily written using C/C++, we also use Go for writing native applications, React/TypeScript for our graphical user interface for both web and native, and Python for tooling and testing. Being part of a focused team means the need for boring meetings is kept to a minimum, and for the most part you&rsquo;ll be concentrating on developing high-quality work. We have a very loose hierarchy meaning that everybody's opinions are always heard and valued, as we firmly believe that good results are achieved in collaboration. In general, we weigh willingness to learn high, so we seek a passionate software developer who seeks to master their craftsmanship and takes pride in developing well-tested and high-quality code.<strong><br /><br /></strong>Also, you will be working at our office located in the NOVI buildings on the Aalborg University campus, where we speak both English and Danish, and where we daily get to enjoy the most amazing food in the canteen.
