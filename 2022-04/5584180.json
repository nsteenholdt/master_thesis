The purpose of this project is to research, design, implement, and test a workflow pipeline for training of machine learning prediction algorithms for cardiovascular events. <br/>\n<br/>\n You will join the Digital Health section of DTU Health Tech. We are a multi-disciplinary team of biomedical engineers, computer scientists, and UX researchers who research digital technologies for health, healthcare, and life science, in order to improve healthcare delivery and make healthcare more personalized and precise. We have an extensive research record within data science in CVD and you will join a team of senior researchers and other PhD students working with us. You will also work closely with cardiologists at the Department of Cardiology at the Copenhagen University Hospital (Danish: Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital) who will provide clinical supervision. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Responsibilities and qualifications</b>\n<br/>\n Your research will focus on establishing an end-to-end pipeline for data science in CVD with a special focus on atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). This pipeline will consist of three main parts: (i) collection of ECG and contextual data from patients, (ii) ground-truth annotation from clinicians, and (iii) a self-optimizing and extensible data science analysis engine containing model for prediction of cardiac events. Primary focus is on the overall software architecture and distributed system design of the pipeline, secondary on the user experience (UX) design of the data collection sub-systems, and tertiary on the design of data science methods. <br/>\n<br/>\n This position requires skills in software engineering, mobile sensing, UX design, and health data science, including software development, mobile programming, sensor integration, distributed computing, and data processing using modern AI- and ML-based tools. Furthermore, a structured approach to research and strong communication skills in English in written and oral dissemination is core. Finally, since you will be spending time with a clinical team at the hospital, good collaborative skills and understanding of clinical work is also important. <br/>\n<br/>\n From an academic point of view, you must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree in addition to a bachelor's degree (180 ECTS points). <br/>\n<br/>\n Ideally, your master degree should be in computer science / engineering or biomedical engineering with a focus on software engineering and data science. <br/>\n<br/>\n More specifically you should have most of the following qualifications: <ul><li>Strong theoretical and practical background in software engineering, software architecture, distributed computing, data science, and human-computer interaction. </li>\n<li>Experience in mobile sensing, ubiquitous computing, and wearable devices. </li>\n<li>Experience in data science methods, incl. machine/deep learning algorithms, especially in ECG or other biomedical signal processing applications. </li>\n<li>Strong mastery of a programming languages like Python, Java, Kotlin, Dart, Swift, or similar. </li>\n<li>Strong communication skills in English - both in writing and orally. </li>\n<li>Knowledge on clinical work, e.g., in cardiology </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n The language of communication at DTU is English. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>We offer</b>\n<br/>\n DTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice. We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment. We strive for academic excellence in an environment characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom tempered by responsibility. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Salary and appointment terms</b>\n<br/>\n The appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. The allowance will be agreed upon with the relevant union. The period of employment is 3 years.
