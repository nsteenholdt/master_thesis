Amorphous metal oxides show enormous potential for applications in electrocatalysis, an essential technology for the green transition. However, challenges in characterizing atomic structure in non-crystalline solid-state compounds hinders rational design of materials. The aim of this project is to unravel structure/property relations in amorphous and highly disordered transition metal oxides for electrocatalysis, so that the most active structural motifs can be identified, and new materials developed. The project includes material synthesis, high level structural analysis using especially X-ray and neutron total scattering methods such as Pair Distribution Function analysis, and <em>in situ </em>and<em> operando </em>studies of material formation and function. The focus is especially on structure analysis.<br/><br/>  Project 2: The project “Metal oxo clusters as building blocks” concern metal oxo clusters, their chemistry and use in energy materials. While nanostructured polyoxometalate ions (POMs) have been known for more than a century, they are now receiving enormous attention, as new applications in energy technologies such as photocatalysis, batteries and supercapacitors are emerging. However, despite decades of POM studies, we have very little knowledge of their solution chemistry, although it is in this form that many of their properties emerge. The aim of this project is to use synchrotron X-ray scattering techniques to obtain an new understanding of nanoscale polyoxometalate clusters in solution, including studies of their growth and use during e.g. photocatalysts. The project includes material synthesis, high level structural analysis using especially X-ray total scattering methods such as Pair Distribution Function analysis and small angle X-ray scattering, and <em>in situ </em>and<em> operando </em>studies of material formation and function. The focus is especially on structure analysis.<br/><br/>  <strong>Who are we looking for?</strong><br/> We are looking for excellent candidates within the field(s) of chemistry, nanoscience or related fields. Both project focuses on structural analysis. The ideel candidate thus has a strong background and experience in methods for analysis of e.g. X-ray diffraction or scattering data, including Rietveld refinement or Pair Distribution Funciton analysis, or other crystallographic methods. Experience in experimental chemistry and material synthesis is also an advantage, as will experience in python programming.<br/><br/>  <strong>Our group and research- and what do we offer?</strong><br/> The work will be done in the Nanostructure group, led by Kirsten Marie Ørnsbjerg Jensen. The group works in materials chemistry and focuses especially on applications of synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering for structure studies of nanomaterials. We are an international and collaborative group, and the work done in the group ranges from computational work, focusing on development data analysis methods, to experimental work such as synthesis in the laboratory.<br/><br/>  The group is a part of Department of Chemistry, Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. We are located in Copenhagen.<br/><br/>  We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in dynamic and international research environment. Our research facilities include modern laboratories, and we are frequent users of synchrotron facilities in Europe and the US.
