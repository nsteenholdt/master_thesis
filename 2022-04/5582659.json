This will allow new insights into the emergence of maladaptive beliefs such as delusions or the distorted views of others which are typical for example in borderline personality disorder.<br/><br/>The quantitative description the project aims for is based on the modelling framework of hierarchical Gaussian filtering. The hierarchical Gaussian filter (HGF) class of models (Mathys, et al., 2011; 2014) can be used to describe mental processes as networks of nodes which pass messages among each other, similar to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In doing this, it links natural and artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>A key advantage of HGFs is their ability to describe the (conscious or unconscious) beliefs that guide decision-making under uncertainty. HGFs describe the uncertainty of beliefs and not only their content. <em>(Mal)adaptive Message Passing in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</em> aims to take this to the next level by extending it to multiple simultaneous inputs.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><br/><b><strong>Formalities</strong></b><br/><br/>Faculty of Arts refers to the Ministerial Order on the Appointment of Academic Staff at Danish Universities<a href=\"http://www.medarbejdere.au.dk/appointment_of_academic_staff_at_universities\" target=\"_blank\"> (the Appointment Order)</a>.<ul><li>Appointment shall be in accordance with the <a href=\"http://www.medarbejdere.au.dk/overenskomst_for_akademikere_i_staten\" target=\"_blank\">collective labour agreement between the Danish Ministry of Finance and the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations</a>.</li><li>Further information on qualification requirements and job content may be found in the<a href=\"https://medarbejdere.au.dk/fileadmin/www.medarbejdere.au.dk/hr/rekruttering/onboarding/ministerial_order_no._1443_of_11_december_2019_on_job_structure_for_academic_staff_at_universities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Memorandum on Job Structure for Academic Staff at Danish Universities </a>.</li><li>Further information on the application and supplementary materials may be found in <a href=\"http://arts.au.dk/en/about-arts/vacant-positions/application-guidelines-academic-positions-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">Application Guidelines</a>.</li></ul>Shortlists may be prepared with the candidates that have been selected for a detailed academic assessment.
