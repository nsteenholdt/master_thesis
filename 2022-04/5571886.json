There is significant potential for information technology (IT) solutions to assist architects and building managers in enhancing health, safety and comfort of occupants while accelerating the drive towards green, sustainble buildings: computer-aided architectural design (CAAD) software tools can support decision-making through automatic building floorplan analysis, and software simulations of daily operations.<br/><br/>This PhD project will be part of a new AU living lab, and will develop and pilot (1) new renovation decision support tools for refurbishing \"Universitetsbyen\", the University City being constructed from a former hospital over the next 5 years, and (2) a \"toolkit\" for producing tender-ready proposals for constructing Solar Panel Parks, which will be piloted at AU Foulum. The project is part of the activities of the H2020 project, PROBONO, funded by the EU and led by Acciona Engineering, Spain.<br/><br/>The project will illustrate how innovative, smart technology and digitalisation can be used to benefit society. Among other things, the project will provide a GBN Digital Twin implemented across the AU Living Lab as a virtual representation of associated GBNs including operational assets that comply with today's sustainability, emissions and health standards in a lifecycle perspective.<br/><br/>This is a research-focused role, where the candidate will conduct a specified program of research supported by research training and development under the supervision and direction of a Principal Investigator/supervisor. The student will integrate PROBONO research into their doctoral studies, the scope of which is to be agreed upon with the supervisor. The doctorate must therefore be aligned with topics relevant to PROBONO.<br/><br/>This Ph.D. project is hosted at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Aarhus University (AU-ECE), Denmark, and is supervised in collaboration with the Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering of Aarhus University (AU-CAE), Denmark.<br/><br/><em>Project description.</em> For technical reasons, you must upload a project description.
