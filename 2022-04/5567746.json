We believe this public environment allows us to stretch the boundaries of what research can be, and what it can lead to. Medical Museion is a part of the Department of Public Health and the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR), allowing close collaboration with scientist colleagues and exposure to a diversity of approaches to health research.  <br/><br/>  We are interested in topics at the intersection of medicine, science, culture and society, including:<br/><br/>  <ul> \t<li>the materiality, history, philosophy, methodology, aesthetics and epistemic workings of medical science</li> \t<li>our relationship to the body, health and the existential sides of our physical being</li> \t<li>the enduring role museums at the intersection of research and society.</li> </ul>  In terms of disciplines, many of our investigative methods relate to Medical Humanities, but staff also comes from backgrounds including the History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine, STS, Material Culture Studies, Visual Anthropology, Museology, and Science Communication.<br/> <br/> <strong>Project description</strong><br/> Companies, countries and foundations pour vast resources into our knowledge-based world by supporting research. This research is also increasingly international and interdisciplinary, presenting new challenges for the organisation and culture of science. There is a long tradition of studying how research environments function, but the relationship between their internal cultures, scientific outputs, and researcher wellbeing  remains under-developed. This PhD project will explore a corner of this enterprise by examining aspects of how research in cross-disciplinary centres is conducted, alongside the experiences of its participants.<br/><br/>  A core interest of the project will be the relationship between what’s good for researchers and what’s good for science: how might researcher wellbeing be linked to knowledge generation and innovation? The PhD will be expected to work together with supervisors to develop a project within this broad field. Pertinent more detailed questions might include:<br/><br/>  <ul> \t<li>how is creativity in research linked to collaboration and connectivity (both within academia and beyond)?</li> \t<li>what value can/should be retained for more individual approaches to doing research?</li> \t<li>what is the role for ‘business thinking’ (missions, goals, strategy, performance, KPIs….) in the organisation and structuring of research, and what other models are available/useful?</li> \t<li>what impact do different scales and speeds have on research and its outputs – big versus small, fast verses slow?</li> </ul>  The successful candidate could come from a variety of backgrounds, including e.g., STS, History and Philosophy of Science, Business Studies, Sociology, Ethnography and/or Biography. It will be important to mix understandings at a macro- and micro-level, balancing more quantitative evidence with qualitative and subjective insights. The incorporation of arts-led investigations – potentially through collaboration – might also yield fascinating insights.<br/><br/>  The research will take its point of departure from Medical Museion’s participation in the <a href=\"https://cbmr.ku.dk/\">Novo Nordisk Foundation Centre for Basic Metabolic Research</a> and connections to other multi-disciplinary research centres in Copenhagen and beyond.<br/> <br/> <strong>Supervisor contact:</strong><br/><br/>  Prof Ken Arnold, Department of Public Health.
