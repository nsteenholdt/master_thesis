Where you are asked for advice and for your contribution to solutions to professional challenges. Where the work-life balance is among the best in the world and where all employees receive free continuing education.</em><br/><br/><strong>We offer a meaningful job and beautiful surroundings to settle in.</strong><br/>Lolland Municipality is looking for Social and Healthcare Assistants to replace a number of employees who are retiring. Lolland is a lovely place to live and work; a scenic island in the southern part of Denmark, with plenty of cultural offerings and with rich club life in sports, among other things. With only an hour and a half drive to Copenhagen, you can easily visit the capital whenever you want, while at the same time enjoy the much lower housing costs in Lolland. Our municipality is developing rapidly, not least because of the construction of the Fehmarnbelt link to Germany, along with a growing international community in Lolland Municipality.<br/><br/><strong>We meet citizens at eye level</strong><br/>Working as a social and healthcare assistant in Denmark is something special. The work takes place both in care centres and in private homes. It works on the principle of 'helping people to help themselves', because being as self-reliant as possible improves people's quality of life. A concrete example of this could be that the social and healthcare assistant provides training for citizens who have just been discharged from the hospital to manage bathing and personal care on their own. You strive to give people content in their everyday life by knowing their life stories and talking to them about their memories. Thus, inclusiveness towards the citizen's way of living is important. In care centres, too, social workers and healthcare assistants seek to create a homely environment with meaningful activities.<br/><br/><strong>Tasks of a very different nature</strong><br/>The scope of work is comprehensive and covers basic care and nursing, consultation and provision of guidance to citizens and their relatives as well as a number of nursing tasks such as pressure ulcer prevention, treatment of traumatic wounds, injections, medication dispensing, catheter care, ostomy care, palliative care and tube feeding.<br/><br/>Thus, the social and healthcare assistant works with the critical, basic nursing tasks while the nurse carries out more specialised tasks.&nbsp;<br/><br/><strong>Requirements and expectations</strong><ul><li>You have a health professional education.</li><li>You have psychological insight and understanding and good interpersonal skills.</li><li>You are responsible, caring and resilient.</li><li>You can work both independently and in teams.</li><li>You are good at getting on with all kinds of citizens and have an approach that acknowledges people.</li><li>You are good at English</li><li>You are willing to learn Danish and motivated to learn our approach to ways of working in the Elderly and Health Sector.</li></ul><strong>Salary and employment conditions</strong><br/>Working hours are 37 hours per week or by appointment. The basic salary is around 3,300 EUR/month, plus paid holidays and pension.<br/><br/><strong>Other important factors: authorisation, knowledge of Danish, housing and lifestyle.</strong><br/>Before arriving in Denmark, you will need to acquire basic Danish language skills via an online language course. We start language courses twice a year; next ones are scheduled to begin in August 2022.<br/><br/>After moving to Denmark, you will complete an intensive Danish course during the first three months of your stay. You will also participate in several social and professional activities during this period to get acquainted with Lolland and your workplace. During this period, Lolland Municipality will ensure that you have housing available to you, after which you will find permanent housing with assistance from us.<br/><br/>An authorisation is required in order to work as a social and healthcare assistant. We help with skills assessment with a view to permanent employment.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://lolland.emply.com/api-v2/file/get-content/1c26f277-5241-4e63-997c-4e0a2f26d922\">In the additional information, you can read more about the total salary package and your working conditions, how the Danish language course is structured.
