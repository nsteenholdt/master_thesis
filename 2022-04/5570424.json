The position is available from 01 August or later.<br/><br/><strong>Research area and project description:</strong><br/>The PhD student will be part of a large international and vibrant collaboration between Aarhus University, Denmark’s Technical University, University of Copenhagen, North Carolina State University and several others. The collaboration project is part of the INTERACT (Decoding the Rhizobiota Interactome for Improved Crop Resilience) project financed by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. INTERACT (<a href=\"https://ccrp.vcl.ncsu.edu/content/interact\" target=\"_blank\">https://ccrp.vcl.ncsu.edu/content/interact</a>) is one of three projects under the CCRP (Crop Collaborative Resiliency Program). The overall aim of INTERACT is to decode microbial interactions in the complex soil matrix, in relation to soil biogeochemical status, water stress as well as pathogen attackthat will improve plant performance. Thus, INTERACT will provide a science-based platform for new agricultural practices and biotechnological solutions enabling plant producers to manage their production ecosystems in a resource-efficient way with limited environmental footprint based on an in-depth understanding of key ecological functions in the wheat rhizosphere. The main focus is to decipher microbial communication among and between protists, bacteria and fungi in rhizosphere and soil environments. Much is unknown about the significance of soil microbes, especially through chemical communication and signalling, on rhizobiome development and function. INTERACT will provide insight into the rhizosphere ecology, as a basis for actively influencing the assembly of effective rhizosphere communities to support plant health and productivity, either through biotechnological or agronomic approaches.<br/><br/>The PhD student will study the protist predators including unicellular fungal and bacterial feeding organisms like flagellates, amoebae and ciliates and their effects on the microbiomes of wheat rhizosphere and soil. The objective is to 1) identify and characterize essential protists and describe their beneficial and detrimental effects to crop health 2) map microbial communication through secondary metabolites and predation on the microbiome 3) unravel the predation mechanism on cross kingdom community assembling process in rhizosphere. Hence, this will increase our understanding of interaction and ecology of protists and microbiomes in rhizosphere and soil. This will be studied both in very controlled laboratory conditions and in step-wise moving towards natural complex systems of soil and rhizosphere. Techniques to be used will encompass conventional methods of culturing, using microscopy and flow cytometry and molecular tools for metagenomics and transcriptomics. The ambition is to identify significance and activity of specific genes for protist activity, predation and exometabolite production and correlate to bacterial abundance, diversity and activity. The PhD position involves contributing to new knowledge on the communication by exudates among predators and prey and thereby impact of protist predators on rhizosphere and soil microbiomes.<br/><br/><strong>Project description</strong> (½-4 pages).
