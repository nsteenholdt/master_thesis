To achieve these goals, the consortium will coordinate a European multidisciplinary and translational research project, closely associated with the global consortium COVID Human Genetic Effort (covidhge.com), relying on a strong and synergistic combination of assets, including unique patient cohorts from 11 EU countries, state-of-the art human genetic, immunological, and virological expertises and technologies.<br/><br/>You will work on projects investigating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, whole exome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of patient samples for the identification and characterization of novel primary immunodeficiencies associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 and other SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations.
