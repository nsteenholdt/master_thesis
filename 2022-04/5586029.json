That way, we help organisations achieve DE&amp;I targets and find the right match for&nbsp;both candidates and companies.

On a daily basis, you will be working closely with our Head of Technology &amp; Engineering. The prospect of translating vision, mission, and business strategy into a product vision and a more short-term product roadmap should sound appealing and challenging to you.</p>\n<p>To become our new Head of Product, we will ask you to submit an anonymised, case-application.

Therefore, it is important that you are a person who finds paths where others get lost.

Thus, collaborating and coordinating across nationalities, workspaces and languages should be intriguing.
