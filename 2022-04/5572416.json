Previously, this was only considered possible in metals through the excitation of plasmons, which unfortunately are associated with large optical losses. This new discovery opens tremendous possibilities for realizing a new regime of strong light-matter interaction, with important applications in quantum technologies as well as for integrating photonics and electronics. Enabled by a newly funded ERC grant as well as a major grant from the Danish National Research Foundation, a number of Departments at the Technical University of Denmark are joining forces in the Center for Nanophotonics (NanoPhoton) to explore this new research field of extreme dielectric confinement.<br/><br/>We are now looking for up to three PhD students, who have excelled in their studies, to join our team, working towards new and highly ambitious research goals at the forefront of this new field. Our research addresses multiple areas and spans quantum optics, solid-state physics, nanotechnology, mathematical modelling, inverse design, integrated photonics, semiconductors, nanofabrication, and spectroscopy. See, e.g., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01681\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01681</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06305\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06305</a> for our latest experimental breakthroughs, theoretical insights, and scientific background for the present positions.
