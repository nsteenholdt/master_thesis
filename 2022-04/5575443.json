Our goal is to develop fast, cheap, environmentally friendly ways to mineralise CO2, to convert it back to solid, where it will remain stable for millennia. Even with the very best alternative energy sources and conversion of CO2 into products, current air and ocean CO2 levels will need 1,000 to 10,000 years to return to preindustrial levels. To reduce climate change and ocean acidification, CO2 must be put back into the Earth, where it came from in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\n At DTU-Physics, we are running several projects in parallel, that range from very fundamental investigations of mineral-water-gas behaviour, through developing predictive models and new experimental methods and instrumentation, to applying research results and building industrial CO2 trapping processes. The need is urgent, the task is challenging and a multidisciplinary approach is essential - so we are looking for highly motivated group members, including physicists, chemists, nanoscientists, mineralogists, geoscientists, engineers and others. We welcome group members at all levels, from young bachelor students to experienced scientists and engineers. </i>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The job</b>\n<br/>\n For the Research Manager position, we expect experience. Your overall responsibility is to be the link between the professor and the university administration, to help the professor and the technical coordinator run the group, to be flexible, to see what is needed and to find the way to get it done. <br/>\n<br/>\n Your main tasks are:<br/>\n<ul><li>academic case management of project contracts and agreements </li>\n<li>to keep an overview of the various projects, task progress and deadlines, from the perspectives of finances, personnel, reports etc. </li>\n<li>organise and coordinate, look for solutions, set people and offices in motion and follow up to see that solutions are reached </li>\n<li>generally support and help the group members, who range in level from young bachelor students to experienced scientists </li>\n<li>communicate with and keep good contacts in the various administration levels, i.e. section, institute and university </li>\n<li>work with the technical coordinator to be sure the expenditures match the grant budgets </li>\n<li>plan meetings, seminars and workshops, travel and accommodation </li>\n<li>help edit reports and papers </li>\n<li>other organising tasks, as needed. </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>Our expectations of you</b>\n<br/>\n We are looking for a structured, quality conscious, broad thinking, university educated, project coordinator who can create an overview and help organise the group's activities. We expect experience in the national and international university and research sector.

At DTU Physics, you would be part of a welcoming, professional, internationally oriented environment, with flexibility in your work life. The CO2 projects we plan will unite researchers from several DTU departments as well as national and international researchers from a number of fields, offering stimulating, dynamic days. The atmosphere in the research group is friendly and supportive, allowing us to produce ground breaking results, of interest to science and essential for industry. We derive new fundamental understanding and use it to solve society's problems. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Salary and appointment terms</b>\n<br/>\n The appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. The salary for the position will be determined by the applicant's qualifications and in agreement with the relevant union. The position is for 6 years. It is full time, starts as soon as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\n The workplace is the DTU Lyngby Campus. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b> Application and contact</b>\n<br/>\n Please submit your online application no later than Monday, 16 May 2022 (Danish time).
