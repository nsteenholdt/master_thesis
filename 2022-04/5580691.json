Conde (Department of Biology) and Associate Professor Fernando Colchero (Department of Mathematics and Computer Science), to analyze changes in demographic metrics across time and environments in Primates and Big Cats.<br /><br /><strong>The project<br /></strong>In recent decades there has been a shift in perception of the role of zoos and aquariums. This has stemmed from a growing effort by these institutions to support species conservation and advance biodiversity knowledge across the tree of life. Over half of the species that have been recently saved from the brink of extinction required ex-situ conservation efforts, often followed by successful reintroductions to their habitat. At the same time, zoos and aquariums have gradually shifted their focus on improving living conditions of animals under their care. However, up to date the extent of the impact of these efforts has not yet been clearly quantified, for instance as increases in time on demographic variables associated to longevity.<br /><br />This project will focus on two mammalian groups (i.e. Primates and Big Cats) which have been at the forefront of the discussion of whether zoos provide adequate living conditions to guarantee their welfare. The aim of the project is to explore temporal trends in demographic welfare indicators for Primates and Big Cats in Zoos.<br /><br /><strong>Required qualifications<br /></strong>Applicants need to have a PhD as well as a background in demography and evolutionary biology demonstrated by scientific publications. Working experience with the data base ZIMS is required as well as a good knowledge of the zoos and aquariums community. Moreover, the candidate should prove proficiency carrying out analyses in the open software R, and have experience in survival and fecundity analyses, ideally using the BaSTA (Bayesian Survival Trajectory Analysis) in R.<br /><br />We are looking for a highly motivated and curiosity-driven candidate.
