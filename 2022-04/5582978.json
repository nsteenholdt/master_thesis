The project will be supervised by Associate Professor Sophie Beeren and is focused in the area of Enzyme-Mediated Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry. The position is funded as part of the ERC Starting-Grant project ENZYME-DCC. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Responsibilities and qualifications</b>\n<br/>\n The PhD project will explore the use of enzyme-catalysed reactions in templated dynamic covalent synthesis - combining supramolecular chemistry and enzymology in a biotechnological approach to oligosaccharide synthesis. This methodology will be used towards the synthesis of novel oligosaccharide-based receptors and foldamers. The work will include the design, organic synthesis and characterisation of molecular building blocks and templates, enzymatic synthesis and analysis of dynamic oligosaccharide mixtures, and physical studies using spectroscopy (NMR, UV-Vis, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy) to investigate conformation, binding phenomenon and self-assembly. Active dissemination of the obtained results, in scientific articles and through participation in international conferences, is an integral part of the job. <br/>\n<br/>\n You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree in chemistry with a focus on synthetic organic chemistry. Experience working with spectroscopy (NMR, UV-Vis, fluorescence, CD) and chromatography analysis (HPLC, LC-MS) is an advantage. Most importantly, the candidate should be highly motivated, able to work independently, and should be very confident in both written and spoken English. The applicant should strive towards scientific excellence and be ambitious and hard-working. Only applicants who seek to be amongst the brightest in their field and work with science at the highest international level will be considered. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarships for the PhD degree are subject to academic approval, and the candidates will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Assessment</b>\n<br/>\n The assessment of the candidates will be made by Associate Professor Sophie Beeren. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>We offer</b>\n<br/>\n DTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice. We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment. We strive for academic excellence in an environment characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom tempered by responsibility. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Salary and appointment terms</b>\n<br/>\n The appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. The allowance will be agreed upon with the relevant union. The period of employment is 3 years. <br/>\n<br/>\n You can read more about career paths at DTU here. http://www.dtu.dk/english/about/job-and-career/working-at-dtu/career-paths <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Further information</b>\n<br/>\n Further questions about the project should be directed to Associate Professor Sophie Beeren, email: sopbee@kemi.dtu.dk <br/>\n<br/>\n You can read more about DTU Chemistry at www.kemi.dtu.dk/english. <br/>\n<br/>\n If you are applying from abroad, you may find useful information on working in Denmark and at DTU at DTU - Moving to Denmark. https://www.dtu.dk/english/about/job-and-career/moving-to-denmark <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Application procedure</b>\n<br/>\n Your complete online application must be submitted no later than 31 May 2022 (Danish time). <br/>\n<br/>\n Applications must be submitted as one PDF file containing all materials to be given consideration.
