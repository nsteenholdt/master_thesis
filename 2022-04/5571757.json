BioMan is suggesting a new biofilm based redox switching approach utilizing fungi in one step to break up lignocellulotic compounds in a pure biotech process. It is expected that this switching biofilm process will also enable the break-down of 99% of the antimicrobials. In BioMan the in depth metabolisation (mineralization) of 4 selected antimicrobials will be explored for the first time in the different parts of the suggested innovative reactor. Metabolites and metabolic pathways will be explored to gain deeper understanding on the aerobic and methanogenic parts of the reactor.<br/><br/>The respective candidate is expected to elucidate degradation pathways and kinetics for antibiotics and biocides under methanogenic and aerobic conditions and relate to the respective operation conditions..<br/>All applications must be made online via the PhD school of Aarhus University and received by 31 May 2022.<br/><br/><em>Project description</em> (½-4 pages).
