 About Seasony   
 Seasony helps vertical farms feed the world with less hassle and more automation   
 By automating the core processes in vertical farming with our modular autonomous mobile robot “Watney” we can offer vertical farms substantial reductions on labor costs and increase yields by increased monitoring. As Watney provides a platform for further automation we have created an open ecosystem for module development, that provides a one-size fits all solution for vertical farms. Together with Watney, we are building a platform that allows a seamless operational experience when setting up automation or browsing through data. The goal – to control everything through a simple, well - designed web app.  
   
 About the position:   
 You will work with our mobile robot consisting of a mobile platform, a lifting module, and a modular top platform to develop new features for autonomous operation in a vertical farming environment. This position is focused on working closely together with experienced mechanical engineers and interns in a fast paced, fast-moving startup where you develop your skills in an accelerated manner. You will be working primarily in Solidworks together with our lead mechanical engineer to design components for the mobile robot and create technical drawings of high fidelity for manufacturing. You will also find and source components from key suppliers whom you will be in direct contact with. We are looking for someone who wants to take responsibility for their work and can be proud of their results. You should as well have an eye for detail and be curious to solve new challenges while being able to design for safety.
