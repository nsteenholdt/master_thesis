Our research explores the interactions between B cells and alpha-synuclein protein aggregates, aiming to uncover the immune system’s role in clearing these toxic proteins and preventing disease progression.   Our research group   The Centre for Stereology and Neuroscience, consisting of 15 staff and students, offers an ambitious and collaborative research environment.  Our multidisciplinary lab focuses on cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s Disease and atypical parkinsonism disorders such as MSA) and brain-related conditions like schizophrenia and dementia. We analyse brain tissue from deceased patients using stereology-based approaches and molecular biology, alongside in vivo and in vitro models for proof-of-mechanism studies. With access to a large brain collection, we collaborate closely with clinicians at the Department of Neurology at Bispebjerg Hospital, and participate in the Centre for Translational Research, encouraging interdisciplinary connections across research units at Bispebjerg Hospital.    You can find more about us at  https://www.bispebjerghospital.dk/cnslab   Project focus   The project hypothesizes that prolonged B cell depletion weakens the immune system’s ability to clear amyloid proteins, leading to increased αSyn aggregation in the brain. Using transgenic mouse models that mimic PD and MSA pathology, we will test various B-cell depletion strategies and explore rescue mechanisms, such as antibody injections and B cell reconstitution.   Our ultimate goal is to evaluate the potential risks associated with immune system weakening in MSA and PD and identify new therapeutic strategies that reduce neurodegeneration.   Key responsibilities   The postdoctoral candidate will play a critical role in the success of this project, with the following primary responsibilities such as Design and Conduct In Vivo Experiments, Immunohistochemical and Molecular Analyses, Data Analysis and Interpretation and Collaborative Engagement. This position offers a unique opportunity to work on a high-risk, high-reward project with the potential to significantly impact on neurodegenerative disease treatments.   We are looking for a person with the following qualifications,     Required :   	   PhD or equivalent in biological, biomedical or pharmaceutical sciences    Experience with in vivo rodent models, and behavioural tests is essential.   Experience in animal stereotaxic injections, blood sampling etc (FELASA C certification or equivalent required)   Experience in data analyses using tools such as R, Python, or MATLAB   Proficient communication skills and ability to work in teams    Excellent English skills written and spoken           Preferred :  	   Experience in immunohistochemistry (IHC), ELISA, Flow Cytometry, Western blotting.   Strong publication record in peer-reviewed journals         Candidates who are adaptable, collaborative, and eager to contribute to multidisciplinary research are especially encouraged to apply.    Expectations and benefits     Establish and oversee animal experiments and ensure rigorous ethical and procedural standards.   Actively participate in lab-wide research activities and contribute to collaborative projects    Publish research findings in high-quality, peer reviewed journals   Present research findings at scientific conferences and engage in outreach activities to broaden the impact of our work   Lead efforts in applying for project funding to support ongoing and future research   Mentor and support graduate and PhD students, encouraging a collaborative and productive research environment.     We offer  a dynamic and collaborative work environment with a strong translational focus, providing you with the opportunity to shape and advance your own research.
