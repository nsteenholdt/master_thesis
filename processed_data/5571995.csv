Our group and research  This project will be carried out in the Center for Computational Evolutionary Morphometrics (CCEM) – a new interdisciplinary center for development of phylogenetic methods for analyses of morphology. The center is led by Stefan Sommer (UCPH), Rasmus Nielsen (UCPH, Berkeley), Mads Nielsen (UCPH) and Christy Hipsley (UCPH).  It is physically located in Copenhagen, but with strong links to University of California, Berkeley. The project participants should expect to participate in visits and research stays at UC Berkeley. This position will be housed in the GLOBE institute, at the section for GeoGenetics:  https://globe.ku.dk/research/geogenetics/ , which is part of the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (SUND).     Project description  Organismal morphology is studied in biology to decode evolutionary relationships among species and to test evolutionary hypotheses in the context of phylogenies. The Stochastic Morphometry project aims to develop statistical models of evolutionary morphological change, thereby making phylogenetic inference tools applicable for the study of shape change. The aim is to develop an entirely new framework for phylogenetic analyses that treat the full 2D or 3D shape, such as a 2D photograph of a butterfly wing or a 3D model of a mammalian cranium, as an evolving object along the branches of a phylogeny. Essentially, we will extend Felsenstein’s classical Brownian motion model of character evolution to use full, infinitely dimensional shapes and stochastic shape processes.   This position will focus on applying the developed computational methods of shape evolution to 2D and 3D biological image data sets. All images are part of ongoing research programs led by UCPH collaborators on high visibility topics: butterfly development, avian diversity, canid domestication and human evolution. The project will be carried out in close collaboration with a team of researchers working on the mathematics of differential geometry and shape transformation, and biologists working on applied phylogenetics.   Specifically, the candidate will compare the performance of our method to more “traditional” morphological (i.e. linear measurements, character matrices) and landmark-based geometric morphometric approaches. The empirical data sets will cover a wide range of animal diversity and biological questions, allowing you to work together with experts in their respective areas to identify which features of the full morphological shape space change in a correlated manner and, specifically, to test current hypotheses about those correlations. Active research areas include: 1) Fluctuating asymmetry in butterflies; 2) Dog domestication; 3) Palaeohominid history; and 4) Bird beak evolution. We will for example estimate left-right butterfly wing asymmetry over time in relation to climatic factors, and generate a phylomorphospace to identify the spatiotemporal onset of domesticated phenotypes of canids.
