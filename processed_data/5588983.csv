The portfolio of third-mission activities ranges from informal to formal interactions between universities and industry partners. Formal interactions, academic entrepreneurship -associated with generating and licensing IP and commercial exploitation via spinouts/start-ups, has attracted most attention in policy research. However, studies have shown informal interactions such as academic engagement - via collaborations, sponsored and contract research, consulting, personnel exchange and networking, also represent valuable ways to pursue third mission. These two ends of the third mission might require faculties and researchers at university to have different but related mind-sets and skills. Yet, a contextualized understanding about potential tensions between academic engagement and academic entrepreneurship and how the tensions affect universities to undertake innovation and perform the traditional missions is largely missing. This PhD project investigates such tensions particularly with respect to how academic staff at Danish and Chinse universities engage in various types of industry collaboration and potentially undertake entrepreneurship activities and how these attempts influence their research and education performance, which might, in turn, create new opportunities for industry collaboration and entrepreneurship.  
 
 This project will adopt a mixed methods approach by combining different sources of quantitative datasets (for all science and technology faculties) to test hypotheses and collecting qualitative data to reveal micro-foundations of the phenomena (tensions) within a specific context. The empirical setting of the project is set at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and/or Aalborg University (AAU), as well as University of Chinese Academy of Science (UCAS) in China.  
 
 The PhD is funded by Sino-Danish Center (SDC) Social Science research PhD program (https://sdc.university/research/phd/) and will be hosted at DTU Centre for Technology Entrepreneurship. During the 3-year PhD project period, the candidate is required to have foreign research stay in China (hosted by UCAS) for 12 months in total. Successful completion of the PhD will be granted a double PhD degree (from both DTU and UCAS). The project must commence within 2022.
