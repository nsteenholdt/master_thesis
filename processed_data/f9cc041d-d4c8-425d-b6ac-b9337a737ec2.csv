The position is for 36 months and is funded by Horizon Europe, within the Hologen  MSCA Doctoral Network . HoloGen is a doctoral network aimed at developing novel computational and experimental tools for the analysis of hologenomics datasets, understanding fundamentals in the hologenomics field, and applying the hologenomic framework for improving human health and production biology systems.   More information may be found on the Hologen home page:  www.hologen-network.eu .   The project aims to achieve breakthroughs by:  1.    Unveiling new host-microbiota interactions.  2.    Developing new technological tools for the study of host-microbiota interactions.  3.    Applying a one-health approach to assess the relevance of host-microbiota interactions.   Hologen will deliver a training program to 11 Doctoral Candidates that equips them with all capabilities to become leaders of tomorrow's R&I in Europe.   Project description  The successful applicant will join a multidisciplinary EU-funded Marie Skłodowska-Curie International PhD training network. This doctoral position is based at the Globe Institute, at University of Copenhagen (UCPH).    This PhD project will investigate the role of intestinal microorganisms in the evolutionary processes of dietary diversification in vertebrates. By combining worldwide field sampling, leveraging the network of the Earth Hologenome Initiative ( www.earthhologenome.org ), and captivity experimentation, the student will explore the mechanisms through which intestinal microbes can facilitate or hamper dietary switches, such as transitioning from carnivory to herbivory. The research will include data generation using the high-throughput automation pipelines available at the Globe Institute’s molecular laboratory, genomic and metagenomic bioinformatic analyses using the local high-performance computation cluster Mjolnir, and statistical analyses using R environment.   The PhD Fellow will also need to carry out field work and captivity experimentation with lizards in Spain. In consequence, the project will require spending long periods of time outside Denmark.    The Doctoral Candidate will be supervised by Associate Professor Antton Alberdi. The Alberdi Lab ( www.alberdilab.dk ) is a dynamic and multidisciplinary group focused on exploring animal-microbiota interactions within ecological, evolutionary, and applied frameworks. Their investigations employ a diverse set of advanced techniques, such as multi-omics analysis, laser microdissection, and gut-on-a-chip models. The group serves as the coordinator for the H2020 RIA project 3D'omics, as well as the founders and coordinators of the Earth Hologenome Initiative.
