The position is available from 01 November 2022 or later. Title: PhD in Greenhouse Gas Emissions Research area and project description: The agricultural sector is responsible for 23% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Denmark, and the Danish Climate Act mandates net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Especially the reduction of CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is paramount to reach this goal. Understanding the driving factors of CO2 and N2O production in agricultural soils can help to understand the source of GHG emissions, and how to reduce GHG during crop production. The PhD candidate’s objective is to increase our understanding of GHG emission processes in agricultural soils in Denmark. Trials will be conducted and aligned to the Klimagræs project (Grant No. 33010-NIFA-19-708) with the objective to quantify GHGs among crop management schemes, and to understand the impact of soil-plant-atmosphere interactions on GHGs in agricultural mineral soils. Therefore, GHG measurements will be conducted in conjunction with measurements of explanatory soil chemical and physical parameters for two cropping seasons. The derived datasets will be used to predict and explain GHG emissions with empirical and/or process-based modelling approaches. The PhD project is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation NNF21OC0072838. Project description.  For technical reasons, you must upload a project description. Please simply copy the project description above, and upload it as a PDF in the application. Qualifications and specific competences: The applicants must have a M.S. degree in Soil Science, Agronomy, Environmental Science or closely related fields. Demonstrated excellent oral and written communication skills in English are required. Basic knowledge of greenhouse gas measurements and/or modelling is of advantage, but not required. The applicant will have the opportunity to present on conferences and publish in peer-reviewed journals. The applicant should be enthusiastic about working in an international and interdisciplinary academic environment.
