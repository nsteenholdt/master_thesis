The project is part of the research project PARAlpha, which is financed by The European Research Council.   Start date is 1st of May 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   About us   We are located at the Department of Biology, and the section from cell biology and physiology in UCPH north campus. The section consists of 11 groups with a broad interest in basic understanding of cell biology and physiology as well as molecular disease mechanisms (https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/cbp/).   Our research    We are interested in the fundamental mechanisms that control secretion of the hormone glucagon from pancreatic alpha cells, and how changes in alpha cell function contribute to the regulation of whole-body metabolism and physiology. We work on cell cultures, primary tissue from genetically modified mouse models and human donors. Using biochemical assays, live cell time lapse microscopy and in-situ perfusion, combined with  in vivo  experiments we explore how alpha cell function is regulated.    Your job   We are looking for individuals interested in exploring alpha cell biology in the context of whole body phsyioilogy. As a PhD student you will participate in a project, in close collaboration with a Postdoc, where we will investigate kinase signaling in alpha cells. The aim of the project is to integrate the mechanisms that regulate glucagon secretion. As part of the project, you will directly work with the generation of viral constructs and use live cell FRET imaging to understand paracrine signaling in alpha cells. You will also participate in the maintenance of several colonies of genetically modified mice and design and perform  in vivo  experiments to understand the role of alpha cells in diabetes development.   Profile   We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic researcher who, in addition to the desired expertise stated above, has the following skills and qualifications:   Required qualifications:     MSc in cell in Biochemistry, biology or similar.   Experience with live cell confocal microscopy   Expertise in calcium imaging analysis   Proven track record showing scientific productivity with at least pending publications in peer-reviewed journals.

The PhD programme    To be eligible for the PhD programme, you must have completed a degree programme, equivalent to a Danish master’s degree (180 ECTS/3 FTE BSc + 120 ECTS/2 FTE MSc) related to the subject area of the project, e.g. Biology, physiology or biochemistry. For information of eligibility of completed programmes, see  General assessments for specific countries  and  Assessment database .   Terms of employment   Employment as PhD fellow is full time and for maximum 3 years.   Employment is conditional upon your successful enrolment as a PhD student at the PhD School at the Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. This requires submission and acceptance of an application for the specific project formulated by the applicant.   The terms of employment and salary are in accordance to the agreement between the Ministry of Finance and The Danish Confederation of Professional Associations on Academics in the State (AC).
