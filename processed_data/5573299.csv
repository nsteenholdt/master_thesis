We are searching for a top international-level scientist in the field of dating geological materials and events to better understand the mechanics and temporal aspects of the Earth system evolution.   Department of Geoscience The Department of Geoscience  currently employs around 110 staff including faculty, externally funded researchers, post-docs, Ph.D. students, and administrative and technical personnel. We have a strong research profile spanning a broad range of geological and geophysical disciplines, including  basic and applied aspects of the Earth surface systems (hydrogeology, hydrogeophysics, Quaternary studies, palaeoceanography, sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochronology, organic petrology) as well as the deep interior of the Earth (petrology, geochemistry, geophysics, structural geology, basin modelling). The Department is well equipped for geochronological and stratigraphical research and teaching with infrastructure including sedimentological, micropalaeontological and geochemical laboratories such as an HF-laboratory, class 100 metal-free clean-laboratory, Q-ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS systems with laser ablation, XRF core scanner, micro-XRF, XRD, EMPA, sediment corers, microscopes, and TCN sample preparation facility. The Department also has strong links to other departments at Aarhus University including Physics and Astronomy (radiocarbon dating facility), Biology, Chemistry and Archaeology, and Technical University of Denmark (OSL dating facility).   Qualifications The ideal candidate must demonstrate interdisciplinary research experience in geochronology with focus on the Cenozoic history of the Earth. Application of absolute dating techniques such as e.g. cosmogenic nuclides to decipher large-scale environmental changes, landscape evolution, Holocene climate fluctuations and human evolution is advantageous. Broad experience with quantitative analytical methods including numerical modelling and utilization of multiple proxies such as e.g. solar activity records is an asset. The candidate is expected to have a leading international research standing and a broad multidisciplinary research network. Their scientific profile will be reflected in relevant publications in prominent international peer-reviewed journals.
