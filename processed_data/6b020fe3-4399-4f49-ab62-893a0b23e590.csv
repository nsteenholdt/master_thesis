About Us  The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR) is an academic research Center that pioneers groundbreaking research towards better cardiometabolic health. Through collaborative interdisciplinary research from single-cell genomics to whole-body systems, CBMR aims to transform the basic understanding of cardiometabolic health and accelerate its translation into prevention and treatment strategies. The Center’s uniquely multi- and interdisciplinary approach combines research in genetics, physiology and pharma­cology, to better understand the complex interplay of the many factors that drive cardiometabolic disease. You can learn more in the  Executive Summary of CBMR's Strategy 2024–2028 .   CBMR was established in 2010 at the  Faculty of Health & Medical Sciences  and has been located in the Maersk Tower at the Panum building since 2017. The around 260 employees create an international, highly collaborative research environment across disciplines.   Our Research  The  Pers Group  investigates the molecular and genetic mechanisms regulating metabolic fuel homeostasis, with a particular focus on the brain’s role in metabolic regulation. We integrate human genetics, single-cell multiomics, and advanced model systems to identify and functionally characterize genetic variants associated with metabolic diseases. Our research combines in vivo approaches using transgenic rodent models to map mechanisms underlying energy balance and glucose homeostasis with iPSC-based systems, including Perturb-seq, to dissect cellular pathways driving disease. We collaborate closely with leading international research groups in molecular obesity and genetics consortia and are part of the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomic Mechanisms of Disease at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT (Cambridge, USA). Our highly interdisciplinary environment provides access to cutting-edge technologies and fosters the development of early-career researchers.   Job Description  The Pers Group is seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to investigate the mechanisms by which human genetic variants associated with obesity influence hypothalamic circuits. This project aims to uncover molecular pathways regulating metabolic homeostasis using a CRISPR-based Perturb-seq system in transgenic animal models, where Cas9 is specifically expressed in reporter animals, enabling targeted gene perturbations in defined hypothalamic and hindbrain cell populations. This Perturb-seq system is currently being established in vivo, providing a strong foundation for immediate experimental work.   This setup allows for single-cell resolution screening of gene expression networks, identifying molecular pathways through which obesity-associated genetic variants impact neuronal function and metabolic regulation. In addition to coupling perturbations to cellular phenotypes, the successfull applicant will integrate these approaches with circuit-level readouts, including neuronal activity measurements, and behavioral phenotyping through advanced rodent metabolic phenotyping techniques, both of which are implemented in core facilities at our center.   The candidate will have access to state-of-the-art facilities and work within a collaborative, interdisciplinary research environment that integrates genetics, single-cell multiomics, and functional validation strategies. Our Center provides extensive opportunities for training and skill development in cutting-edge techniques, such as CRISPR-based Perturb-seq, fiber photometry, and advanced rodent metabolic phenotyping. Our group closely collaborates with Dr. Martin G. Myers (University of Michigan, USA) and Dr. Michael W. Schwartz (Washington University, USA), bringing together expertise in neuroendocrinology, metabolic regulation, and functional genomics to advance our understanding of obesity-associated mechanisms. Additionally, we work closely with researchers at the Broad Institute (Cambridge, USA) on the variant-to-function aspects of the project, leveraging cutting-edge genomic tools to functionally characterize obesity-associated genetic variants. The project will also involve interactions with leading international research groups specializing in molecular obesity and metabolic disease.   Profile  We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic scientist with the following competencies and experience:   Desirable qualifications:     PhD in molecular biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, or a related field.   Strong scientific track record (i.e., publications, training) relative to career stage.   Experience with rodent models and in vivo metabolic phenotyping techniques.   Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, preferably with experience in computational analysis of sequencing datasets.   Experience with neuroscience techniques, such as fiber photometry or stereotactic injections, is advantageous but not required.   Experience with viral vectors and genetic perturbation techniques is a plus.   Familiarity with single-cell or multiomic techniques is preferred.   A FELASA or equivalent certification for animal experimentation is desirable.   Excellent English communication skills, both written and oral.       Terms of Employment  The employment as Postdoc is a full-time position for 3 years. Starting date is May 1, 2025, or after agreement.   Salary, pension and terms of employment will be in accordance with the agreement between the Danish Ministry of Taxation and AC (Danish Confederation of Professional Associations). Depending on qualifications, a supplement may be negotiated.   Non-Danish and Danish applicants may be eligible for tax reductions if they hold a PhD degree and have not lived in Denmark for the past 10 years.
