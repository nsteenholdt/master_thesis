Description of the scientific environment   The PhD position is placed at the Section for Geography at IGN, and is embedded in a collaboration with The National Geological Survey (GEUS) and the Section for Geology at IGN.   The successful candidate will work with researchers focusing on remote sensing, natural resource management and hydrology.    Project description  The PhD fellow will develop methods to map drained fields using remote sensing and machine-learning. Based on this, the phd fellow will construct a national map of drained fields in Denmark. While drainage benefits farmers it carries adverse environmental impacts related to a.o. leaching of nitrogen, phosphorous, and agrochemicals to the aquatic environment, and CO2 and N2O emissions to the atmosphere from drained organic wetlands and poorly drained depressions in cultivated fields.   The map serves direct societal and environmental purposes: it will help farmers manage application of nutrients and provide a new tool to manage and mitigate nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to the environment. The map could also reveal which wetlands are well/poorly drained, and thus assist a prioritized and cost-effective re-wetting of drained wetlands to reduce CO2-e emissions to the atmosphere. The national drainage map is expected to be a cornerstone in the agricultural sector’s green transition.
