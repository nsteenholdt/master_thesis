 As an Operations Technician at Everfuel, you will be responsible for installation, commissioning, operation, and maintenance of hydrogen fuelling stations, hydrogen trailers, and electrolysers all over Europe, starting with new hydrogen fuelling station placed in Heinenoord. 
 It will be your responsibility to ensure that the customers can fuel their vehicles when they need to, by making sure that all assets are available 24/7. 
 You will be responsible for highly sophisticated equipment consisting of software, electronics, pneumatic, mechanical, process, and cooling elements. Therefore, it is important that you are a fast learner as we do not expect you to be proficient in all areas from the beginning. 
 As hydrogen is under high pressure it is extremely important that you have a good mindset for safety and never compromise that. 
 You will report to the Operations Manager of Everfuel in Fredericia, Denmark. You will be part of an ever-growing international team of motivated people who are dedicated to make green hydrogen for transportation a competitive alternative to fossil fuels. You will have one local Dutch colleague when you start, but the organisation is expected to grow. 

Your tasks will include:

 
 Documenting potential failures and quality issues, which includes providing feedback to the responsible manager/engineer 
 Supporting colleagues in your areas of expertise 
 Suggesting and implementing improvements to installing, operating and maintaining our equipment, as well as our processes 
 Helping customers on site to operate the fuelling equipment 
 

Skilled Technician with Experience in Installation and Service of Complex Machinery

 You hold a relevant educational background and experience in installation, commissioning, service, and maintenance of complex machines or plants. You have a strong, technical orientated mindset, are curious, and can quickly understand complex technical systems to find potential technical failures, quality issues, and solutions. 
 You are structured, consistent, and clear with documentation, and follow work procedures safely and efficiently. As a person, you are dedicated to your job, and you want to make a difference in the world by working with a company that wants to make green transportation possible. Furthermore, you are proficient in both written and spoken English. 

Moreover, we imagine that you have:

 
 Experience working within established service procedures, instructions, bill of materials, and norms 
 Good knowledge in the remote operation and monitoring of complex systems 
 The ability to consistently maintain an organized and clean work area in the workshop and onsite 
 Willingness to travel.
