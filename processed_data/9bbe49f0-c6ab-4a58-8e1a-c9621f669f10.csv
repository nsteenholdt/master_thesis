You can find details on all open positions in the network at potentmsca.cbs.dk. Ports as Energy Transition Hubs (POTENT) Network – The PhD Positions The objective of the three PhD positions is to investigate how ports can support and accelerate the clean energy transition in Europe. Please indicate which of the three positions you are applying to in your application. Facilitators of the clean energy transition: Port governance and business model innovation :  This Candidate will be based at the Department of Strategy and Innovation working with  Henrik Sornn-Friese  and  Michele Acciaro , and will focus on the topics of port governance, business model innovation, institutional entrepreneurship, and clean energy transition. You will be seconded with KEDGE Business School and the Port of Esbjerg during the project. The position’s objectives are (1) Develop a taxonomy/DCM tool for port authorities about value proposition of ports with regards to the clean energy transition, (2) Design a theoretical framework for broader business eco-system based on mid-range theory aiming to explain and envisage how ports can innovate their business models to facilitate and profit from the clean energy transition, and (3) Outline policy recommendation/DCM tool under a case study design based on case studies of ports transitioning to become clean energy hubs. Socio-economic aspects of energy port transition :  This Candidate will be based at the Department of Economics working with  Tooraj Jamasb  and  Christine Brandstätt  and will focus on energy infrastructure development and related topics such as offshore energy, economic regulation, green fuels and their interface and relation with onshore and inland energy systems and infrastructure. You will be seconded with the Norwegian School of Economics and the Danish Utility Regulator. The position’s objectives are (1) Review and assess the state-of-the-art in economics of energy infrastructure development in support of the green energy transition, (2) Explore new economic regulatory frameworks and models for energy infrastructure and ports, (3) Assess new market designs, business models, stakeholder engagement, innovation strategies, and energy policies that support green transition, and (4) Study integration and linkages between offshore infrastructure and resources with the wider energy systems. Energy Ports in System and Network Perspective :  This Candidate will be based at the Department of Strategy and Innovation working with  Henrik Sornn-Friese  and  Tooraj Jamasb  and will focus on the topics of energy technology systems, renewable energy supply chain, environmental impact assessment. You will be seconded with Kühne Logistics University and the UNCTAD, United Nations. The position’s objectives are (1) Investigate this role in a system perspective, looking particularly at the development of onshore power supply (OPS) for cruise ships in ports, (2) Address OPS in ports from the perspective of sector coupling linking the energy and maritime sectors, (3) Assess the position of ports in the renewable energy supply chain, linking ports to offshore renewable energy sectors as well as the inland economy, and (4) study the system of ports in a regional/global context with a view to network externalities and achieving economies of scale.

This collaborative research project provides a fantastic opportunity for researchers interested in the clean energy transition and the role that ports can play in this transition. It aims to integrate knowledge of engineering (e.g., mechanical and electrical engineering) and social sciences (economics, sociology, and anthropology) in a doctoral training programme across 8 European research institutions and 15 industry actors. The POTENT consortium brings together a multidisciplinary research team from across Europe to train experts in port energy systems and develop key skills to deliver a just and sustainable energy transition. Ports are increasingly recognized as key enablers of the clean energy transition, playing a crucial role in supporting Europe’s shift toward climate neutrality and energy security.
