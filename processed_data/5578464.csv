The starting date for the positions is September 1, 2022. Application deadline is June 30, 2022.  
 SDU Center for Energy Informatics (CEI) is an interdisciplinary industry-oriented research and innovation center with an international outlook. The center focuses on development of innovative digital energy solutions that can facilitate the transition towards a sustainable energy system. The center is part of the Faculty of Engineering (TEK), University of Southern Denmark, and located at the main Campus in Odense, Denmark.  
 Profile and requirements To apply for the 4+4 PhD positions, it is required that the applicant is enrolled in one of the Faculty of Engineering master’s programmes in Energy Systems Engineering or Software Engineering plus has completed the first year at the time for enrollment. 
 We are looking for highly motivated and ambitious students with excellent knowledge of English (written and spoken), who can work well in a team as well as independently and quickly acquire knowledge in new topics.  
 About the PhD positions The PhD positions are offered within the following research topics. 
 Topic 1. Multi-dimensional assessment of resiliency and sustainability sector coupling  solutions 
 This research topic aims to develop an AI-based forecasting and multi-criteria evaluation framework for assessing the resiliency and sustainability of sector coupling designs and strategies. The framework will provide stakeholders in the energy ecosystem with foresight on the future consequences of alternative designs and strategies for sector coupling solutions. The research will be conducted in collaboration with national and international companies and organizations representing stakeholders in the energy ecosystem. 
 Topic 2: Identification, classification and prediction of driver behavior for optimal fuel consumption 
 The aim of this research topic is to develop and implement AI-based methods for identifying, classifying, and predicting optimal driver behavior for reducing fuel consumption in the transportation sector. The developed methods will be used in a real-time Advisory system for coaching drivers to avoid excessive fuel consumption. The research is conducted in collaboration with leading companies and organizations in the Danish transportation sector. 
 Topic 3: Identification and classification of process operation patterns for optimal energy consumption and product quality 
 The focus of this research topic is to develop a data-driven AI framework for identifying and classifying best-practice patterns for energy-efficient operation of industrial processes. The framework will provide companies in the manufacturing and process industry with actionable insights on the energy use of their daily operations and enable them to take actions to reduce their CO2e emissions. The research is conducted in collaboration with leading companies in the Danish IT and industrial sectors. 
 Topic 4: Open data spaces for provision of AI-based smart city services  
 This research topic focus on the development and deployment of enabling technologies for creation of open data spaces that can facilitate the innovation of AI-based smart city services. The research will provide companies with insight and best-practice for establishing their data and AI development workflows. The research is conducted in collaboration with leading global providers of open-source platforms and the European ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems community on digital transformation for green energy transition. 
 Topic 5: Smart asset maintenance and management for electric power distribution grids 
 The purpose of this research topic is to develop a machine learning-based prescriptive maintenance and asset management tool that enables distribution system operators to reduce their asset maintenance and management costs. The developed tool will provide DSOs with actionable insight about their grid assets before faults are expected to occur. The research is conducted in collaboration with Danish DSOs and leading companies in the energy sector. 
 Topic 6: Digital Twins for buildings energy performance optimization and intelligence quotient enhancement 
 The aim of this research topic is the design, development, and demonstration of an innovative digital twin platform to optimize buildings energy performance and enhance their intelligence quotient. The digital twin platform will improve best practice for building performance monitoring, commissioning, and operation management. The research is a collaboration between commercial and public partners. 
 Topic 7: A Digital Twin solution for optimal energy retrofit decision-making and decarbonization of buildings 
 The research is aiming to design, develop, and demonstrate a digital twin solution to serve for optimal energy retrofits decision-making, retro-commissioning and performance optimization of existing non-residential buildings. The digital twin solution will enable building owners and facility manager to make cost-optimal decision for building retrofits and operational management. The project is in collaboration between IT companies and building owners in the public sector.
