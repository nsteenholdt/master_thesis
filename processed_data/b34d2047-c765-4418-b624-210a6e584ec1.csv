 Immersion engineering is taking care of all calculations regarding tunnel elements float up (weight analysis, determine ballast concrete and water, longitudinal section forces, floating stability), transfers in basins and harbour (winch operations with or without vessel assistance), mooring of the tunnel elements, transport to offshore location, immersion (including but not limited to dynamic analyses) and the stability of the elements after immersion. 
 As an immersion engineer, you will participate in the team responsible for floating up and/or hoisting the concrete tunnel elements, equipping them in the port and then transporting and installing them at sea. In a first phase you will participate in the preparation of this crucial operation, by making ballast plans e.g.. In a second phase, you will be part of the operational team that does the immersion work, by going offshore and assist the Immersion Master by giving technical advice. This is what you are pre-pared to do in Denmark (full time or in 4-2 rotation). 
Who is FLC?
 Femern Link Contractors, FLC, is the joint venture responsible for the design and construction of the Northern Europe’s biggest construction project resulting in the longest immersed tunnel in the world.

 During float up and ballasting you check if operations stay within boundary conditions and act accordingly. 
 During the execution phase, you advise during the transport and installation of the elements. You will be present in the command unit of the immersion pontoons during offshore operations. 
 You will do checks during execution, monitor the immersion process, and have an advisory role to the one in charge of the operation. You are also prepared and ready to deal with contingencies if any might occur. 
 After immersion, you will do checks on data to create lessons learned for next operations.

 You are a qualified civil engineer (expertise in hydrodynamics) or are a naval architect/maritime engineer with minimum of 7 years experience. 
 You have prior experience with immersion of large structures or offshore lifting operations. 
 You have a good understanding of stability calculations, mooring calculations and hydrodynamics. 
 You are a hands-on problem solver, not afraid of taking decisions. 
 You are a team player with strong communication skills. 
 You find it a challenge to work in a very international, multi-cultural work-environment in which communication and team spirit is key to success.
