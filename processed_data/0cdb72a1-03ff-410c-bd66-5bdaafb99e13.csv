The position is available from 1 April 2025 or later. You can submit your application via the link under 'how to apply'. Title Novel pre-and post-treatment technologies to optimize anaerobic digestion Research area and project description Biogas plays a very important role in the green transition of the society. The biogas technology is an environmental well-developed technology that besides the energy production also has several others environmental benefits such as removal of pollutants, reduction of greenhouse gases and improving the fertilizer value. However, there is still several possibilities to improve the efficiency by pre- and posttreatment of the substrates used. The objectives are: (i) to identify and optimize cost-effective pre-treatment methods, evaluating their impact on gas yield and the removal of micropollutants, (ii) to develop an innovative digester design by implementing serial connections of digesters with optimized retention times and temperatures, (iii) to investigate the influence of applied pre-treatment on the formation of degradation products of micropollutants and their subsequent effects on the anaerobic digestion process. The aims are to design innovative pre-treatment technologies for effluents containing micropollutants. The focus will be on efficient reactor configurations and process conditions to optimize the pre-treatment process, specifically targeting the breakdown of complex organic compounds. Additionally, systematically investigating the impact of diverse pre-treatment methods on biogas production and the overall treatment quality by post-anaerobic digestion. Furthermore, the project will encompass an evaluation of cost-effective analysis and finally upscale the most efficient combination of pre-treatment and anaerobic digestion processes. This PhD position is funded by the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Doctoral Network (MSCA-DN) within the NEUTEN Project, which focuses on energy-neutral wastewater treatment systems. The project is part of the European Union’s Horizon Europe program, aiming to train a new generation of researchers in developing innovative environmental solutions to address complex water and energy challenges across Europe. Salary, holiday payment, pension contributions and the like include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. Thus, figures are before taxes are paid, and taxes may differ depending on individual circumstances. Salary and terms of employment are in accordance with applicable collective agreement, and salary is depending on seniority. Salary includes a non-pensionable PhD supplement. The allowances mentioned in the EU work programme (living allowance, mobility allowance and, if applicable, family allowance) will be part of the salary. Allowance rates can be found in  the relevant EU Work Programme  (under MSCA doctoral network - Applicable unit contributions), and country correction coefficient can be found in the same document.

Qualifications and specific competences The successful candidate holds a master’s degree in civil engineering, in biotechnology, biological engineering, process technology, environmental technology or similar (120 ECTS). The candidate should be able to work independently and be problem solving oriented. Experience in the following areas would be of advantage: Biological reactor technology and operation of anaerobic and aerobic bioreactors. Chemical analytical skills. You should: have good communication skills both in oral and written English be able to write scientific publications be able to work independently but also in collaboration with other students and staff We expect that you will be an active part of the research environment and that you will contribute positively to the social working environment.
