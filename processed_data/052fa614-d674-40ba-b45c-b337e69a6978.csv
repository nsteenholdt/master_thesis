The position is available from 15 June 2025 or as soon as possible hereafter. The position is for 1 year, with the possibility for an extension of at least 1 additional year, based on performance and upon mutual agreement. Description of research project This project aims to develop novel methods to directly probe the phase behavior, i.e., the number and types of phases, in individual aerosol particles, and to explore how it affects their ability to form clouds. The project will focus on secondary organic aerosol (SOA), a major type of atmospheric particles, that impact atmospheric chemistry, air quality and climate. SOA particles can respond to changes in atmospheric conditions by undergoing phase separation or mixing. This results in particles with either multiple condensed phases or a single condensed phase, respectively. These changes can also alter the phase state of SOA particles, often described by their dynamic viscosity, causing them to transition between liquid, semi-solid, or solid (glassy) states. In this project, we aim to develop methods to accurately quantify these changes in aerosol phase behavior. We will deploy microscopy-based techniques to probe the phase behavior of well characterized particles. Through targeted experiments, complex SOA types will be generated in our atmospheric simulation chamber ( AURA ), where advanced instrumentation is available, from oxidation of different precursor gases. Expected responsibilities & duties Build and develop methodologies for measuring phase behavior of SOA. Carry out experiments in atmospheric simulation chamber. Document and present research results to scientific and public audiences and writing of scientific publications. Maintain safe and clean laboratory space and follow the  FAIR  principles in conducting scientific research. Interact with and guide junior researchers. Where experience is lacking, the candidate must be motivated to learn and will get the opportunity to develop new skills. We are seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher who will help develop new methods to probe aerosols phase behavior and who actively engages in related research projects in the group and C3. Your profile PhD degree in Atmospheric Science, Chemistry, Physics, Nanoscience, Environmental Engineering, Meteorology or similar. Strong interest in atmospheric sciences, documented by relevant publications. Documented experience with instrumentation to probe aerosol and/or cloud particles. Experience with microscopy is advantageous. Demonstrated skills in computer programming and analysis of complex data sets. Excellent English language and communication skills (written and oral), critical thinking, instrument trouble shooting. Good collaboration skills and ability to take responsibility to work independently and proactively on their project. Good project management skills, work result-oriented with attention to detail.   Who we are The department: The Department of Chemistry at Aarhus University (www.chem.au.dk) is one of the leading European chemistry departments with a broad research program.
