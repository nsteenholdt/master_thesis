Depending on the obtaining of additional funding it is the plan to expand the duration of the position.   The position is based at the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate (CMEC) at the Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen. Information on the department can be found at:  www.macroecology.ku.dk  and  www.globe.ku.dk . The project is funded by the Danish Innovation Fund, as part of the Biodiversa+ project FunDive (https://fun-dive.eu). FunDive combines citizen science, AI tools, and eDNA-based monitoring to develop better methodologies for fungal monitoring and conservation. We also aim to explore changes in fungal communities over time and space and assess the effectiveness of current conservation efforts for globally threatened fungi.   Our group and research   You will be part of an international research-collaboration aiming to set new standards for mapping and monitoring of fungal biodiversity, combing citizen science and professional expert based monitoring, including environmental DNA (eDNA). We seek to impact practical conservation, by bridging between state of the art in science, monitoring and conservation policy at the European scale. We emphasize teamwork and collaborations both inside CMEC and within the European network of collaborators in FunDive. We strive to maintain a supportive and inclusive group where the experiences and skills of everyone help to build a productive, synergetic, and friendly culture and working environment.   CMEC is a center of excellence with a cross-disciplinary research program. We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in a dynamic and international research environment addressing fundamental questions on the origin, maintenance, conservation, and future of life and biological diversity on Earth. The 40+ researchers at CMEC currently represent 14 different nationalities and the working language is English. The center juxtaposes faculty staff scientists from the fields of macroecology, historical biogeography, conservation science, oceanography, evolutionary biology, community ecology, population biology, climate change research, and environmental economics.     Your job   The position is part of the project FunDive (monitoring and mapping Fungal Diversity for nature conservation) coordinated from CMEC and involving partners in more than 20 European countries. The project coordinator, Assoc. Prof. Jacob Heilmann-Clausen will act as your main Academic supervisor.   The overall project aim is to put fungal biodiversity on the map to enhance European conservation efforts. Fungi constitute a very diverse group of often highly specialised organisms that are often neglected in monitoring and practical conservation efforts, leaving them vulnerable to threats and habitat loss. In addition they play crucial roles in ecosystems, and hence changes in fungal community composition may be early signs of fundamental changes in ecosystem functioning.   The position is related to WP5 in the project, which focus on the investigation of fungal diversity and community composition based on existing and newly collected data stemming from both citizen science and eDNA sampling. Your focus will be to explore if existing conservation measures are adequate to protect fungal biodiversity in Europe. More specifically, you will evaluate how well the EU habitat directive and national protection schemes protect fungal biodiversity including globally threatened fungi. Further, you will explore how different sampling strategies capture data on threatened fungi, and how sampling biases can be identified and addressed to make monitoring more robust and targeted.   You will have the main responsibility for conducting the research described above, in collaboration with your supervisor and external project partners in FunDive. Within the overall frames of the project scope, you will have the opportunity to shape your own research projects. You are expected to lead the development of at least one first authored paper for publication in high-ranking international peer-reviewed journal. In addition, participation in collaborative projects with other lead authors is participated. You will also have the opportunity to gain experience in teaching and supervise MSc and BSc student thesis projects.   Profile   We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic scientist with the following competencies and experience:   Essential experience and skills:     A PhD in conservation science, biology, or other environmental sciences.   First-author papers in international peer-reviewed journals   Good understanding of fungal ecology and macrofungal diversity   Good understanding of biodiversity conservation, including monitoring, management and policies   Experience in statistical analysis (for example Mixed-Effects models and/or spatial data-analysis).   Proficient communication skills and ability to work in teams   Excellent English skills written and spoken     Desirable experience and skills:     Experience with field mycology and fungal identification   Experience in teaching and supervising undergraduate and MSc students   Experience with citizen science and/or monitoring of biodiversity involving volunteers   Experience with remote sensing and GIS     Place of employment   The place of employment is at Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate (CMEC) at the GLOBE Institute, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.
