We expect applicants to have an academic background within economics and documented empirical research competence of high international standard within economics and specifically within one or more of the below mentioned research fields:     Economic incentives related to food consumption   Innovation and consumer value in the food system   Economic linkages between food consumption and other stages of the food supply chain      The professor is expected to maintain a significant record of publication at the highest level, to encourage research achievement and to nurture a research culture within the research group.

Finally, the professor will be expected to contribute to management and leadership through engagement with and participation in Department and Faculty governance structures.

The group has a tradition for working in large multidisciplinary research projects and wants to develop a stronger focus on the roles of consumers in food systems.    Assessment of applicants  will primarily consider their level of documented, original scientific production at an international level, including contributions to developments in their field, as well as their documented teaching qualifications. Managerial and out-reach qualifications of applicants and their ability to attract external funding will also be considered.   Six overall criteria apply for professor appointments at the University of Copenhagen.
