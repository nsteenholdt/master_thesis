 What will your new working day look like? 
 An exciting and varied everyday life in our production awaits you together with our skilled and committed team. Your work encompasses challenges ranging from manufacturing tasks to volume assignments, where your creativity is put to the test - whether it be the production of an item or the continuous optimization of the entire production process. We have a wide range of customers ranging from small newly formed companies with particular needs in specialized advice, dialogue and product optimization, to larger companies with their own development department and extensive production knowledge. Furthermore, we have several customers who use us as a sparring partner in product development and prototype production, where we are able to influence the design of the individual items as well as entire products. That means the tasks are versatile and challenging in the best of ways.  
 Among other things, you will be able to work on: 
 
 Production of drawing-specific items, prototypes / smaller series: 
 
 
 Task definition / time estimation 
 Programming 4- and 5-axis machining centers

 Who are you? 
 We are looking for a new colleague who is responsible, able to work independently, but not afraid to chip in and help complete a group assignment when needed. You are persistent in your endeavors, even when times get a bit rough. Whether you are new to the labor market, or a seasoned veteran, is not what matters most to us - the most important thing is that you are quality-conscious with a great drive and desire to learn and develop yourself - professionally as well as personally. 
 In addition, we would like it if you were: 
 
 Trained as an industrial technician or tool maker 
 Proficient with Master Cam, and know its strengths and weaknesses 
 Familiar with various machining methods in machining 
 Have experience with clamping methods in milling 
 Can construct in Solid Works 
 
 What do we offer? 
 In addition to you becoming part of our fantastic family and a stable company with healthy ambitions, we also offer: 
 
 Competitive wages with pension and health insurance, starting at 30.000 kr./month, to be adjusted according to qualifications. 
 Working conditions with a strong focus on your safety 
 Freedom under responsibility (flexible working hours) 
 The best and newest machinery in the industry 
 A varying everyday life with different tasks, primarily in milling, and to a lesser extent turning 
 A company in growth 
 Opportunity to develop personally and professionally. 
 
 Interested?
