The positions are fixed-term full-time employment (two years). The starting date is 1 April 2025 (or as agreed upon).  Job description The position is an interesting opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher to work with a variety of projects on Energy Systems. The candidate will support several of these activities jointly with other researchers. The core pillars of the current research proposal include the following: Flexibility and stability of the power system This will include research study regarding the security that the European transmission system should have through various scenarios that may lead to widespread outages or even blackouts, and how these must be prevented must be examined. HVDC interconnections and the new energy storage technologies (e.g., hydrogen) will also be examined. Hybrid power systems Technical and economic analysis of hybrid power plants combining photovoltaics, wind, hydrogen, and battery storage technologies using software for real case scenarios. Optimization techniques for energy harvesting The following techniques will be applied for optimizing energy harvesting: - Developing Optimization Algorithms for Parameter Extraction of Solar Modules. - Applying Artificial Neural Networks and/or machine learning techniques to maximum power point tracking in solar panels for different radiation and temperatures. Suggestions for the redesigning process of the current European electricity energy market  As the EU electricity market is designed to incentivize the clean energy transition while delivering on key objectives of energy security and affordability, the methods listed below are some of those that can be used for this goal: •    Accurate prediction of the energy production from RES utilizing next-generation technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and weather-based models. •    Accurate power load prediction using AI and machine learning as well.  •    Energy storage needed at the national and European level, finding the optimal sizing and location of these energy storage technologies. •    Implementation of energy storage technologies in the future pan-European electricity energy market. Qualification requirements A PhD in energy engineering, electrical engineering, power engineering, or a related field completed within the last 5 years. A strong background in mathematics and analysis from the PhD studies, which may be used to perform research assessments on clean energy technologies and the power system (transmission and distribution). Proficiency in using MATLAB, HOMER Pro, and NEPLAN. The candidate is expected to have a proven track record in AI and Machine Learning, in particular in topics relevant to the research projects stated above. Experience in developing mathematical and computational tools for modeling power systems. Knowledge of the European Energy Market will be an advantage.
