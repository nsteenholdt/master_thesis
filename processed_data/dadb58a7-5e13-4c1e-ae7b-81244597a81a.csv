The projects are part of the research center Hybrid Quantum Networks, which is financed by the Danish National Research Foundation.    Start date is (expected to be) July  1, 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The projects  The projects deal with hybrid quantum systems combining optical waveguides and cavities with atoms, quantum dots and optomechanical components. In one project, we shall develop theory proposals and analyses of quantum networs of coupled few-level systems interacting with continuous wave beams and pulses of radiation. In the other project we shall deal with probed quantum systems, in particular the use of mechanical oscillator modes for sensing,  control and mediation of quantum states between different systems. Collaboration and sharing of methods and ideas between the students on the two projects is expected.     Who are we looking for?  We are looking for candidates within the field(s) of quantum optics and quantum information science. Applicants may have a background from theoretical or experimental atomic or solid state physics, quantum optics, nanophotonics, optomechanics. The work will derive and employ deterministic and stochastic master equations, Gaussian approximations and cumulant expansion methods. These methods are fairly straightforward to learn, and we are first and foremost looking for creative and innovative candidates with general competences in modelling and programming and a genuine interest and sense for experimental feasibility and relevance.     Our group and research- and what do we offer?  The group is a part of the Hybrid Quantum Networks Centre of Excellence, financed by the Danish National Research Foundation, and located at the  Niels Bohr Institute, Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen.  The group is led by Professor Klaus Mølmer, and we enjoy close collaboration with the theory group led by Professor Anders Sørensen and with experimental groups working on optomchanics, single photon emitters, nanophotonics and quantum sensors. A specific focus of both theory groups is discussions and engagement of students and postdocs in projects with experimentalists in and outside of the Niels Bohr Institute.  The theory groups have weekly joint meetings, and we have monthly lunch meetings and annual retreats with the whole Hybrid Quantum Networks Centre. From sping 2025, we will be located in a new building with  laboratories, offices and meeting rooms, and the more than 50  staff, students and postdocs will enjoy daily interactions as they hang out and bump into each other for tea and coffee in our lounge facilities.      Principal supervisor  is   Professor Klaus Mølmer, Niels Bohr Institute,  klaus.molmer@nbi.ku.dk , +45 2338 2321.     The PhD programme  consists of  A  three year full-time study  within the framework of  the regular PhD programme  (5+3 scheme).  To be eligible for the PhD programme, you must have completed a physics degree programme, equivalent to a Danish master’s degree (180 ECTS/3 FTE BSc + 120 ECTS/2 FTE MSc) related to the subject area of the project. For information of eligibility of completed programmes, see  General assessments for specific countries  and  Assessment database .     Terms of employment   Employment as PhD fellow is full time and for maximum 3 years.  Employment is conditional upon your successful enrolment as a PhD student at the PhD School at the Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. This requires submission and acceptance of an application for the specific project formulated by the applicant.
