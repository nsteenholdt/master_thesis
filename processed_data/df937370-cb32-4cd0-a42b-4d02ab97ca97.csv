The position is available on the Gamifying Green Governance project, funded by the Danish Independent Research Fund (2024-2027). For details of the qualification requirements for the position, please see below.     Gamifying Green Governance Project  The project explores the introduction of gamification mechanisms into green volunteering in China. Globally, volunteering is an important aspect of the green transition: it enrols people into local networks of engagement, is consistently recommended as an antidote to climate despair, and in China alone, amounts to 1.6 billion hours of service per year (Yuan 2022).   In Gamifiying Green Governance, we explore what happens when green volunteering is gamified, when ‘doing good’ (Hoffman and StJohn 2017) becomes morally ambiguous, interrogating both the freighting of public good with private gain and raising fundamental questions about the politics of gamification for planetary ends. We are interested in everyday volunteering moralities, and – building on a prior project called Moving Data-Moving People – in the relationship between volunteering and credit. We will explore ‘green’ volunteering as one of several mechanisms of credit rectification and aim to better understand how ‘green’ volunteering is experienced and conceptualised by those who organise and take part in it.   We approach green volunteering ethnographically and are interested in how people describe, collect information about, communicate, register, value, manage, and feel about it. The project will use a range of approaches to understand this, foregrounding ethnographic fieldwork, digital ethnography and document analysis.   For more about the project, see https://blogit.itu.dk/gggproject/     Job Description  The postdoctoral researcher will be the key fieldworker in the project. They will be required to carry out independent research and over the course of the project, work closely with the PI, Rachel Douglas-Jones.   The postdoctoral researcher will construct a piece of independent research to take place during the project. The location of the fieldwork is open, and candidates are encouraged to consider how to make use of their existing networks, and, where appropriate and feasible, the project’s collaborating partner and its networks, the Ecology and Cultures Innovation Lab at Tongji University, Shanghai.   The researcher will conduct ethnographic fieldwork, formal and informal interviews, and co-construct questions about green volunteering with participants in the field, based on the project’s orienting questions. They will have a capacity for building empirically on their own, and project-based interests in quantification, everyday moralities, volunteering, ‘green’ action, digital ethnography, and gamification. They will have the ability to manage a fieldwork budget.   Additional tasks during the project may include participation in and organization of PhD courses, organizing seminars and workshops, meetings with the Advisory Board, the preparation of manuscripts for publication, and guest lectures.   Prospective candidates are warmly invited to contact the PI ahead of applying to discuss the project or work environment.
