Title Biodegradable Conducting Polymeric Material in Degradable Electronic Devices Research area and project description: Do you want to contribute in building a sustainable future? Does working with materials and electronics excite you? If yes, we are looking for you. We are seeking a PhD candidate for a fully funded project under Villum fonden for 3 years at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aarhus University, starting from Jan 2023. We are looking for a highly creative and motivated applicant, who will work on a multidisciplinary project at the intersection of polymer materials, electronic engineering and additive manufacturing. The project seeks to address societal challenges around sustainability of electronic materials for devices. The main aims and objectives of the project are: Develop a new class of electronically functional biodegradable material based organic-inorganic composite with a polymer matrix. Design experiments to ascertain the biodegradability of the material and find the conditions required? Use printing methods for fabricating a flexible electronic device, in cooperation with the post-doctoral candidate. Who are we? The successful candidate will join ‘Printed Electronics Technology’ laboratory led by Associate Professor Shweta Agarwala. This is a dynamic interdisciplinary research group with competences in organic/inorganic material synthesis, printed ink formulation, printing technologies and device fabrication. The PhD candidate will work closely with other team members in a collaborative manner. What we offer? The successful candidate is offered: a chance to make an impact and carry out cutting-edge research. access to a well-developed research infrastructure. a research climate inviting lively, open and critical discussion within and across different fields of research. a working environment with teamwork, close working relations, network activities among young scientists and social activities. a workplace characterized by professionalism, equality and a healthy work-life balance.
