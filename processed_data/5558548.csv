 Your role 
 You will design, develop and maintain medical software solutions used worldwide by audiologists, hearing aid dispensers, universities, schools and more. Together with your skilled team members located in Middelfart and Stettin, Poland, you will participate actively in all phases of software development. 
 You will work with 
 
 .NET (C#, WPF, WebAPI, SignalR and Blazor) 
 Architecture principles (SOLID, MVVM, DDD, CQRS, Hexagonal, general design patterns etc.) 
 Database technologies (EF Core, SQLite and MSSQL) 
 Authentication & Authorization (OAuth2 and OIDC) 
 Agile development methods (Scrum) 
 Automated test and release (CI/CD) 
 
 Experience in some of the above areas will be an advantage. However, the most important thing is that you are currious and willing to learn. And to get the best possible start, you will get a thorough introduction to the organisation, departments, markets and customers through our Onboarding Programme. 
 A typical day will consist of a daily stand up meeting with your colleagues in Middelfart and Stettin, Poland where the current progress and potential impediments are shared with your team members. Afterwards, you will continue implementing the next cutting-edge audiological test, refactor existing code for handling data between shared components or fix a critical bug in print wizard that handles generic printing logic. Later the same day, maybe you will attend a department meeting to get an update on the state of the company, do knowledge sharing or perhaps get insight into how Operations are changing their current way of working. 
 Our future 
 Interacoustics wishes to support and strengthen your personal development through clear and tangible goals. Hence, we make use of recurrent one-on-one meetings in combination with the more formal yearly Development dialogue to ensure progress in your personal and professional development. The possibilities are many and maybe you have a wish to move into a role as a Scrum Master, Senior Software Engineer, Software Architect or Software Project Manager at a later stage.
