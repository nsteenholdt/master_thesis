Do you have a solid feel for UX, software design and the technical chops to bring everything together into one neat package? Then (please) don't shy away and continue reading. This position could be yours! Adversus' ambitions are high, our organization is flat, and we always strive to learn and have fun while doing it. 

Next-gen sales acceleration platform

 Since 2016, Adversus has strived to be a market leader in a competitive field that requires high availability and high uptime. Adversus has experienced exponential growth in recent years, both in demand of the product itself but also the company. Today, we have 40+ employees located at our headquarters in Aarhus. Adversus' solution is an all-in-one sales acceleration platform that supports our customers' needs for an effective, structured and data-driven daily routine. Delivering an efficient and stable experience with a high level of usability is key to our high user satisfaction. When spending most of their day on our platform, our users often need deep insights into their data and are always looking for ways to optimize their setup. Our platform unites three different tools; a telecommunications system, an automation system and a CRM system. Because of these many aspects, our application needs to be able to handle the unexpected, and present a solid user experience even when nothing works. As our new full stack developer, you'll be welcomed with open arms by a team of 11 developers and join them in delivering the next generation of our software. 

What will you be working with?

 Your primary responsibilities will be implementing new features and services that extend the capabilities of our main application, as well as improving the existing ones. This includes work on our various automation systems, on demand large scale task processing, and keeping our integrations up date. You will also be expected to be able to work with our frontend application, helping out with improving some of the technical views, and sometimes prototype new interfaces for new features.. You should be familiar with async processing flows, data driven programming, and be able to implement them both on the backend and frontend. You should be interested in working with new technologies, and some very old ones, and be able to start working on problems where you may not know all the details up front. 
 We got a somewhat complicated tech stack running behind the scenes, but most of what you need to know can be covered by the following: 
 
 React / Typescript / Tailwind 
 PHP / MySQL / NodeJS / Redis 
 
 And some of the extra flavor you will probably end up interacting with are these: 
 
 Elastic search / WebRTC / SignalR / RabbitMQ

 While we'd love to see that you hold a relevant degree that has some relation to what you're going to do, you mainly need the technical chops and experience to call yourself a senior full stack engineer. How you've come about that specific skill set is less important.  
You have experience with some of our core tech stack and are ready to take on a challenge when it comes to the other stuff. 
You will have to be effective at communicating in English. 
As a person, you are disciplined, reliable, and ready to be a team player. You take responsibility and understand how your development work will contribute to our customers' business needs. You love being part of a humorous work environment, and you are curious about new technologies. 
   
 This is what Adversus can offer you. 
 We offer you a full-time job with an attractive and competitive salary package to match your qualifications and experience. We're pretty flexible about a lot of things (work at home days, meeting times), but we would prefer that you are available during at least some of our regular business hours. 
While we do have some remote people employed, our office space is newly decorated and located right in the heart of Aarhus, so if you value excellent working conditions, we think we got that covered too. 
 
You will have full health and dental insurance, pension, and an IT setup tailored to your preferences.
