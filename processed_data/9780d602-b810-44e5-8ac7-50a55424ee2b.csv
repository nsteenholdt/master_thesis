As an internationally reputed elite university, DTU is at the forefront of innovation related to “the sustainable transition.” At the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (DTU Biosustain), we are specifically looking for new ways to support the sustainable production of bio-chemicals, and that is why we need you and all your good process simulation, automation and sustainability assessment skills. The project aims to channel information from fundamental research to a decision support tool for experimental researchers to tune their process parameters and foresee the corresponding sustainability impacts. 
 Building the first-of-its-kind of gas fermentation process simulation and estimating sustainability performance 
 
 Your job is to support the vision of sustainable bio-chemical production. You will do so by designing novel production schemes to integrate supply chain information of the feedstocks with techno-economic and environmental assessment tools. Specifically, you will be responsible for identifying the most commercially viable gas fermentation process representing a production-scale operation. You will be engaging with biologists, chemical/bioprocess and environmental scientists/engineers to generate key indicators and eventually, building a database and open-source models to be executed by the global biotechnology community. One of the key aspects of this PhD project is to spread knowledge to stakeholders active in the biotech sector in the Nordics. Hence, in this project supported by the NordForsk grant (HERO-Protein Project), we seek a proactive candidate with a strong background in supply chain optimization, mathematical modeling of production systems, chemical/bioprocess simulation and quantitative sustainability assessment. 
 Your primary tasks will be to:  
 Design a framework to support informed decision making for stakeholders interested in microbially produced proteins using non-conventional feedstocks. 
 Identify locations of feedstocks of feedstocks such as CO2 and H2 and ability to rank those based on practical considerations. 
 Develop a mathematical model for determining the optimal location for future gas fermentation-based production facilities, using programming approaches. 
 Developing detailed process simulations (validated with partner information and hypothetical theoretical cases) and subsequently, performing Techno-Economic and Life Cycle Assessments (SimaPro, OpenLCA and/or Brightway Tools). 
 Deploy combined open-source tools (preferably in Python Programming Language) to facilitate dissemination of science and tests to curate the outcomes generated during the PhD project via GitHub. 
 Synthesize findings into insights and actionable recommendations.  
 
 Our expectations of you 
 
 Track record of working with both GUI-based and code-based applications to optimize process simulations and environmental assessment software's (please highlight the specifics in the cover letter). 
 A sound understanding of techno-economic assessments and life cycle assessments is a needed skill. 
 Good communication skills and demonstrable experience of delivering time-bound tasks. 
 Traveling among the NordForsk projects partner institutes in Iceland, Finland and Estonia to gather data and present the research at international conferences. 
 The ability to demonstrate and operate in line with the team’s core values. These are excellence, teamwork, integrity, respect, and stewardship. 
 Have experience in interacting with international academic and industrial stakeholders. 
 
 You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. 
 Approval and Enrolment 
   
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see  DTU's rules for the PhD education
