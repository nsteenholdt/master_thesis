Start date is (expected to be) July 1st 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project   The project concerns the synthesis of biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates using a combination of molecular design and dynamic combinatorial chemistry. While there will be a strong emphasis of synthetic organic chemistry, it is expected that tools from the physical organic chemistry toolbox will be widely used, including a range of spectroscopic methods, ITC and crystallography. A secondary goal of the project is to prepare an artificial enzyme that rely of the biomimetic molecular recognition of carbohydrates.   Who are we looking for?   We are looking for candidates within the field(s) of synthetic organic chemistry and supramolecular chemistry. Candidates must have a MSc in organic chemisty of related field with a strong background in preperative chemistry.   Our group and research- and what do we offer?   In the research group we focus on a range of scientific questions. We are interested in both supramolecular chemistry and in aromatic chemistry. Almost all activities in the group are centered around organic synthesis, and we offer a strong interdisciplinary and international work environment.
