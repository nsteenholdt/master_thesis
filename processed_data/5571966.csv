The position is at the Section for Microbial Ecology and Biotechnology  https://plen.ku.dk/forskning/mikrobiel-oekologi-og-bioteknologi/ , and initially anchored in the Environmental Microbial Genomics (EMG) group headed by Professor Lars Hestbjerg Hansen.   The genetic context of e.g. secondary metabolites, antibiotic resistance genes or pesticide degradation genes is hugely important to their actual function. This context-driven approach is still underexplored in microbial genomics, but important in order to exploit the real potential of microbial solutions for societal challenges.   To address this developing field of microbial genomics, we are seeking a candidate with a research background in microbial genomics, bioinformatics and sequencing technologies in a microbial ecology and biotechnology context. With this position, we would like to strengthen research in all aspects of microbial genetics, with special emphasis on genetic parasites (plasmids, phages, transposons etc.) and their bacterial interactions, and involvement of these parasites in the active genetic development of antifungal properties, antibiotic resistance, xenobiotic degradation pathways and other functions relevant to humans and the environment. As part of the section’s strategy, the tenure track assistant professor will work towards establishing an independent research group, focusing on studying microbial genome evolution, genetic parasites and their impact on important phenotypic traits.    The candidate will be expected to conduct independent research at the highest international level and establish his/her own research program within the area of microbial genetics, supported by external funding. As part of providing research-based teaching, the teaching obligations will be within microbiology, bioinformatics and microbial genetics at all levels. It will be an advantage that the candidate has teaching experience from relevant courses, and it is expected that the candidate will undergo necessary pedagogical training. For non-native Danish speakers, it is furthermore expected that the candidate will be able to teach in Danish after three years.     The candidate is expected to be enthusiastic about working in an interdisciplinary academic environment. The position, therefore, requires a highly motivated scientist who is comfortable working in teams, have good interpersonal skills, as well as a collaborative and open mind-set. It is expected that the candidate develops leadership skills with the aim of gradually taking on administrative duties as required e.g. research group leader and other departmental services.   Research and teaching at the Department of Plant and Environmental Science, focus on plants, animals, soil, and microorganisms – from molecules through organisms to populations and anthropogenic ecosystems. The institute hosts state-of-the-art infrastructure, field research facilities, and many opportunities for collaborations within the department. It is our vision to maintain and develop our position as one of the principal centres for solving global challenges within agriculture, climate and plant science, based on excellent basic and applied research.   The Section for Microbial Ecology and Biotechnology conducts research in the areas of microbial ecology, environmental microbiology and microbial biotechnology. We aim to understand and exploit microbial diversity and interactions from both a genetic and ecological perspective and deliver basic knowledge as well as applied solutions to challenges within environmental pollution, plant production, aquaculture production and microbial ecosystem services.      Qualifications     A Ph.D. or similar qualifications within virology, microbiology, biotechnology or other relevant research fields   Three to seven years of post-graduate research experience within microbial genomics and bioinformatics   An internationally competitive research output documented by a substantial number of co-authored scientific papers in internationally recognized journals, and experience in grant writing to attract external funding within the field of microbial genomics and genetic context-driven research.    Extensive experience within Illumina and Nanopore sequencing (from library building to bioinformatics analysis) is desirable, with emphasis on non-standard applications on the Nanopore platform.    A documented experience with teaching at the university level will be considered an advantage, as well as commitment to teach.   Commitment to and interest in the continued development of courses within the research area, and supervision at the BSc and MSc level   Good collaborative skills and a record of collaborative projects with academic or external stakeholders.   Experience with outreach activities and communication of research to the public via e.g., popular science articles.   Commitment to and interest in taking on administrative duties as required, e.g., as research group leader and other departmental services.   Commitment to achieve fluency in Danish as soon as possible, and no later than within 3 years (BSc level courses are taught in Danish).       Assessment of applicants  will primarily consider their level of documented, internationally competitive research. The experience in grant writing to attract external funding will be strongly considered together with outreach qualifications. Teaching experience and formal didactic training are not mandatory but documented teaching qualifications/formal didactic training and teaching experience will be considered.    Six overall criteria apply for assistant professor appointments at the University of Copenhagen. The six criteria (research, teaching, societal impact, organisational contribution, external funding and leadership) are considered a framework for the overall assessment of candidates. Furthermore, each candidate must be assessed according to the specific requirements stated in the job advertisement.
