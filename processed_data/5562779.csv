The ADD project is a large, ten-year project conducted by partners and research groups at six Danish universities. The project also includes a significant outreach activity organised by Mandag Morgen. This is a full-time (37 hours/week) position. It is expected to begin on 15 August 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter, and to end 14 months later on 14 October 2023. The position is located at DPU, Copenhagen Campus, within the  Department of Education Studies  as well as with the research programme for  Future Technology, Culture and Learning . The Danish School of Education is committed to diversity and encourages all qualified applicants to apply regardless of their personal background.   Research context The ADD project addresses the democratic issues associated with the rapidly increasing use of algorithms in all sectors of society. One frequently voiced concern is that algorithms may lead to biased and non-transparent decision making, which again may erode trust in key societal institutions and decision-making processes. The overall aim of the ADD project is to understand the processes and circumstances that give rise to controversies relating to algorithms, to raise public awareness of algorithms, and to promote the democratically legitimate development of algorithms in Danish society. The project will conduct basic computer science research on algorithmic bias as well as a substantial number of qualitative case studies of algorithm controversies in areas such as privacy & cybersecurity, public administration, finance, health and innovation practices. Further descriptions of the project can be found here:  https://algoritmer.org/om-os/projektet/ The DPU research group in the ADD project studies the Danish public administration’s development and use of predictive algorithms, with a special interest in understanding how the development and use of predictive algorithms based on machine learning reconfigure the relationship between state and citizens. Predictive analytics typically categorises citizens with respect to their predicted future risky behaviour. The potentials and promises of these AI techniques are obvious: they help public administration to tailor and target the citizens who are most at risk, and may even prevent and intercept risky behaviour. However, as the numerous public and political debates concerning predictive analytics have shown, the public administration’s use of predictive analytics is fraught with dilemmas and competing values. Understanding predictive analytics as a new form of expertise entering and shaping the way in which public administration relates to citizens, we are interested in exploring issues related to changing forms of expertise and value chains in public-sector administration.   The position The postdoc will work in close collaboration with the project team at DPU, consisting of co-PI Helene Friis Ratner, another postdoctoral scholar and one PhD student, as well as with other participants in the ADD project. The primary task of the postdoc will be to identify, collect and analyse empirical data about changing forms of expertise in public-sector administration, such as the mobilisation of this expertise, e.g. in public-private partnerships, its re-organisation of public-sector administration, its co-existence with other forms of expertise, professional disputes, the practices and negotiations involved in materialising predictive algorithms as part of public-sector expertise, and how these ultimately affect citizens. Applicants are encouraged to contact the co-principal investigator Helene Friis Ratner on +45 3082 6019 or at  helr@edu.au.dk  for further information about the project. The postdoc is expected to: Be an active collaborative partner in the research project Conduct and complete an independent research project related to the project topic and in collaboration with the group Publish independently and in collaboration with the DPU co-PI and research group in relevant peer-reviewed journals Initiate and organise activities with the project group, affiliated students and the academic world at large (co-organise and participate in research conferences, seminars and webinars as well as related activities) Contribute to the popular dissemination of research findings. The application must include a proposal for a postdoctoral research project (one-two pages), detailing the research question, its conceptual and methodological foundation and a timetable. It must be possible to complete this project within a 14-month period. Qualifications Applicants must hold a PhD degree or equivalent qualifications in science and technology studies, organisation studies, anthropology, sociology, ethnography or a related discipline within the humanities or social sciences. Applicants must be able to document a relevant, international, high-quality research profile, including experience of international publication and research dissemination. They must also document: Proven skills in qualitative research methods and data analysis Experience of working with qualitative methods The ability to collaborate in interdisciplinary research teams The ability to initiate relevant activities in an academic environment. It is an advantage if applicants can also document: Theoretical and conceptual familiarity with science and technology studies, the sociology of knowledge, critical software studies, and/or public administration Knowledge and experience of researching public-sector institutions, digitalisation, datafication and/or artificial intelligence Experience of dissemination and outreach activities. Given the nature of the project’s empirical work, basic Danish or other Scandinavian language skills will be advantageous but are not required. Applicants must be fluent (or near fluent) in speaking and writing English, and experience of publishing in English is considered an asset. Please note that applications that do not include uploaded publications (maximum five) will not be considered. The application must be submitted in English.   Work environment Active participation in the daily life of the department is a high priority, and we emphasise the importance of good working relationships, both among colleagues and with our students. In order to maintain and develop the department’s excellent teaching and research environment, the successful applicant is expected to be present at the department on a daily, or at least weekly, basis. We respect the balance between work and private life and strive to create a work environment in which that balance can be maintained.
