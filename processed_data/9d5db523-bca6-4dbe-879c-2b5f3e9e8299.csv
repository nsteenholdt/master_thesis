The position will be opened at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Aarhus University, and the candidate will be working within the Center for Interstellar Catalysis.   Expected start date and duration of employment This is a 16-month position from 1st May 2025 or as soon as possible.   Job description This position is funded by the Villum Experiment Grant titled “Molecular Motions in Frozen Water”, which aims to study spontaneous polarisation effects in thin layers of water ice that are of relevance to astrochemistry. When dipolar molecules condense on a substrate at cryo-temperatures, the resulting films often spontaneously harbour electric fields that result from the collective ordering of molecular dipoles. This phenomenon manifests as a polarisation potential at the film surface. Direct measurement of the surface potential allows for characterisation of the degree of molecular orientation within the film. Changes in the degree of molecular orientation induced by temperature, for example, can be used to quantify molecular diffusion. This project aims to build an instrument capable of directly measuring these surface potentials and, by doing so, to explore a new method for quantifying molecular diffusion in molecular films. Other types of experimental data, including scanning tunnelling microscopy imaging and neutron reflectivity will then be used to place the surface potential measurements in context. The successful candidate will be expected to build an electron irradiation source capable of measuring surface potentials atop condensed films of molecular ices prepared under astrochemically relevant conditions. They will work within the Center for Interstellar Catalysis, under the supervision of project PI Andrew Cassidy and the Center Leader, Liv Hornekær. The position will include the following tasks; To design, build and test a low energy, electron irradiation source. To participate in ongoing experiments at the AU-UV beamline at the ASTRID2 synchrotron facility, at the host institution, where this electron source is to be implemented. To participate in ongoing neutron reflectivity experiments at the AMOR beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland To participate in ongoing low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments within the Center for Interstellar Catalysis. To assist with the supervision of students involved in the above experiments. To be an active, intellectually contributing and supportive member of the Center for Interstellar Catalysis.   Your profile Applicants should hold a PhD in experimental physics, physical chemistry or a similarly related field. Demonstrated expertise in some or all of the following areas will be preferred; Using synchrotron radiation for surface science experiments. Using neutron scattering techniques for characterising the condensed phase. Low-temperature scanning tunnelling-microscopy. Water ice chemistry and structure. Molecular diffusion on surfaces. Demonstrated expertise in some of the following areas will be beneficial but is not required; Experimental astrochemistry. Molecular films of water and other ices. Molecular diffusion. Electron optics. The applicant should have good proficiency in English and should be able to work positively and communicatively in a team. Applicants are asked to submit the following documents:  a 1-page cover letter stating the relevant experience, projects and motivation for applying for the position.  a cv containing a list of publications and contact details for at least 2 referees.   Who we are You will join the Center for Interstellar Catalysis, within the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Aarhus University.
