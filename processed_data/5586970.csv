Special focus will be on using genomic prediction for more efficient selection of new varieties and prediction on specific combining ability between line crosses used in production as three are considerable heterosis observed in both species. This will involve estimation of variance components including both genotyped and non-genotyped individuals and optimum methods to handle genotype by environment interactions for traits recoded under different locations and weather conditions. Methods for evaluation and comparison of models should be developed and implemented in hybrid breeding schemes that involves three separate breeding populations. The position is for 2 years of employment and there are possibilities for extension up to a maximum of 4 years if the candidate is considered qualified and sufficient funding is available. The position is related to collaborative project together with commercial breeding companies with the goal of developing methods and models that can be implemented in practical applications. The candidate will work on the analysis of data from ongoing experiments, and from ongoing commercial selection programs. Results and hypothesis will be verified using complex stochastic simulation models and implemented in models for optimization of breeding programs. The position provides excellent possibilities for access to state-of-the-art tools for simulation and for the analysis of complex genomic large-scale datasets, writing publications, collaboration with industry partners as well as with other research groups.   Qualifications   Ph.D. or equivalent in plant/animal breeding, quantitative genetics, quantitative genomics, statistics, or related fields. Strong interest in use of highly stochastic models for the analysis of phenotypic and genomic data. Proficiency in conducting large-scale computations. Good understanding of methods used in genomic prediction. General understanding of commercial breeding programs. Good skills in oral and written communication in English. Ability to work in a large and diverse group of researchers, and collaborate with national and international partners form research and industry.   Who we are: Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics (QGG) The institute like center, QGG, is a major center for research and education in quantitative genetics and quantitative genomics ( www.qgg.au.dk/en ) at Aarhus University. We perform basic and applied research within livestock and plant breeding as well as human applications in precision medicine. The research within QGG is characterized by a very close synergy between method development, basic analysis, and application of the developed methods on practical problems across species in collaboration with industry partners. QGG is an international research Center with about 70 employees and visiting researchers from over 15 nations. QGG works in teams and strive for an excellent working environment. We therefore value self-leadership, open communication, respect for diversity and success in mentoring, supervision and teaching.
