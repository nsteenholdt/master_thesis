The project is part of a research project investigating how parental histones are segregated at DNA replication forks for epigenetic modifications to be faithfully passed on from mother to daughter cells. It is financed by the Novo Nordisk Foundation.   Start date is expected to be 1st May 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  The project builds on our recent discovery that the replisome-associated factor Mrc1 (in fission yeast) and its homologue Claspin (in mammals) help distribute parental histones between leading and lagging strands during DNA replication.  This preserves the epigenetic memory encoded in the post-translational modification of histones ( Cell  187:5029-5047, 2024).  The project will ask whether Mrc1 and Claspin also exert regulatory roles on chromatin replication and whether they might coordinate DNA and chromatin replication to protect chromatin structure under DNA replication stress. Potential mechanisms are suggested by current knowledge of how Mrc1 and Claspin regulate DNA replication. A major goal will be to reveal replisome components and aspects of chromatin replication that are necessary for epigenetic inheritance, with broad implications in health and disease.   Who are we looking for?  We are looking for excellent candidates within the fields of biology, biochemistry, genetics or molecular biomedicine. Skills in molecular biology, genomics, fluorescence microscopy, protein science or the handling of fission yeast would be desirable. Motivation, enthusiasm and commitment will be factored in the evaluation in addition to academic excellence.   Our group and research- and what do we offer?  Our group has had a long-lasting interest in chromatin structure and epigenetic inheritance. We use genetics, genomics and fluorescence microscopy to investigate how heterochromatic histone modifications propagate along chromosomes and how this is affected by transcription and replication and by the 3D organization of the cell nucleus. A fruitful approach we recently implemented in fission yeast has been to monitor cell populations in transition states over periods of time, from a few days to a few weeks, at the single-cell level.  As much as possible, we aim at obtaining quantitative data suitable for mathematical modelling of epigenetic states; modelling is performed in collaboration with Physicists at the Niels Bohr Institute.    The BioCenter where we are located offers excellent work conditions in a dynamic and international research environment.  The project will be in collaboration with Pr. Hisao Masai, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Research, Japan, and with Pr. Anja Groth, University of Copenhagen and Danish Cancer Society, both offering excellent opportunities for changes of environment and project development.   Principal supervisor  is Associate Pr.
