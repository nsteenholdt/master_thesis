 If so, the DTU Wind & Energy Systems, Division Wind Energy Materials and Components invites applicants for a 3-year PhD position starting in October 2022. The Ph.D. project will be supervised by Associate Professor Xiao Chen, Chief Development Engineer Malcolm McGugan and head of section Senior Scientist Kim Branner.  
 
 The PhD project will develop novel methods to identify and evaluate typical damages of composite wind turbine blades at structural level using the sate-of-the-art computer vision algorithms and machine learning technologies. The project aligns with several on-going research projects in the areas of structural health monitoring and damage prognostics of composite wind turbine blades using computer vision and data analytics, taking advantage of excellent testing and modelling capabilities at our department. The project is expect to combine both physics-based and data-driven approaches to achieve efficient and reliable damage assessment for future large offshore wind turbine blades and similar large-scale structures.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 During this PhD project, you are expected to:  Conduct experimental investigation on damage characterization of composite blade structures when the blades are subject to complex loading using passive thermal imaging, acoustic emission, ultrasonic scanning in collaboration with our engineers and technicians.  
 Develop computer vision algorithms to extract structural dynamic characteristics of the blades when they are subject to complex fatigue loading.  
 Develop computer vision algorithms to identify, track and analyze blade damages that progress during the loading.  
 Develop thermographic data analytic tools for wind turbine structural health monitoring using Machine learning/image processing.  
 Validate the performance of your model by comparison of the damage states with the detailed damage coordination and geometry measured experimentally.  
 Disseminate the results in peer-reviewed top profile journals.  
 
 
 As a formal qualification, you must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. Furthermore, strong English communication skills are essential. Applicants should be highly motivated, ambitious, and eager to seek and share knowledge, willing and able to work independently and in a team.  
 
 More specifically, you should have the following qualifications:  Fundamental understanding and good experience with the state-of-the-art image processing and computer vision algorithms.  
 Fundamental understanding and good experience with the state-of-the-art technologies for data analysis.  
 Experience with composite materials and structures, and condition monitoring.  
 Excellent written and communication skills in English.
