We are looking for a medical doctor with an interest in cancer cell biology (including cancer genetics), pharmacology, immunotherapy, and treatment response monitoring by liquid biopsy for an international research project addressing the treatment of sarcomas in children and young adults.    Background  The most common childhood sarcomas (Ewing, osteo-, synovial and rhabdomyosarcomas) are all highly malignant mesenchymal tumors with a relatively poor prognosis on 1st-line therapy, a 5-year overall survival (OS) of ~60%, and few   survivors after relapse, even when relapse surgery leads to complete macroscopic remission. The prognosis of refractory/high risk/relapsed sarcoma has changed little over the last decades, and innovative treatment approaches are needed.   Most sarcomas are immunologically silent with low tumor mutational burden and a “cold” microenvironment. Accordingly, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment has generally been disappointing with little or no responses. In an international network, including Barcelona, Copenhagen, Düsseldorf, Prague, Vienna, and Zürich, we are developing novel strategies that can enhance the efficacy of ICIs towards high-risk sarcomas.   About the position  The purpose of the PhD position is to deepen our understanding of sarcoma biology, including genetics, further develop our innovative phase 2 clinical trial protocol, and initiate its implementation at our collaborative European pediatric oncology sites.   The supervisory group will include professor Kjeld Schmiegelow, chief physician Lisa Hjalgrim (both Copenhagen), and professor Jaume Mora (Barcelona).    Research in an established research environment  You will become part of an established international collaboration and cooperate with researchers at other de-partments at Rigshospitalet or abroad. A total of 3-6 months stays at the research lab group in Barcelona and/or one of the other participating centers are expected during the PhD employment.   Your everyday work will be at Bonkolab, Rigshospitalet, the largest pediatric cancer research unit in the Nordic region with more than 130 employees. You will be part of a community with a large group of PhD students and Postdocs, all doing research within paediatric oncology, including several with a specific focus on sarcomas and pharmacology. You will also collaborate with Bonkolab’s permanent staff, who can support your development as a researcher. At Bonkolab, we are passionate about our projects and prioritize a safe and inspiring research environment.    Our expectations  We are looking for someone who will immerse themselves in basic biological as well as translational research, including genetics, pharmacology, immunology, and clinical trials. You are conscientious and transparent in your work, as well as engaged, proactive, structured, and have good collaborative skills. We expect you to be able to work independently, but you will always receive the necessary training and support from the supervisory team and your other colleagues.   Your work will primarily involve:      Finalizing our innovative phase 2 clinical trial protocol   Implementation of the clinical trial in collaboration with our European collaborators;   Genetic and methylation profiling of sarcomas;   Liquid biopsy interpretation;   Scientific communication, especially through publications both nationally and internationally      Unless you have had extensive clinical training in pediatric oncology, you will have 2 months of clinical work in the pediatric cancer department, Rigshospitalet, to gain insight into the treatment process for this patient group and other childhood cancers.    Qualifications      Master's degree in medicine (MD);    Documented research experience is an advantage but not a requirement;    Strong collaborative skills;   Interest in handling and interpreting complex data. Programming in R (or similar) is an advantage, but not a requirement.   Laboratory experience is an advantage but not a requirement.   Strong written and oral proficiency in English.      Evaluation of applicants  The selection of the right PhD candidate will be a two-phase process. After an initial screening of applicants, you will be invited for an interview. A maximum of 5 applicants will proceed to a test process, after which all will be invited to a second interview.   Employment terms  Salary and employment terms follow the agreement for Region H.  Positions at the Juliane Marie Centre are subject to a child protection certificate. Therefore, it is a requirement for employment that you have a clean child protection certificate. The center will obtain the certificate from the National Police with the applicant’s consent.  Rigshospitalet is a smoke-free workplace.  Rigshospitalet is part of the Capital Region of Denmark.    Application procedure  A written application explaining your interest in the project, along with your CV, should be submitted through the link on the page no later than February 11. Interviews will take place and finalized in February.
