We are now looking for a  Postdoc  with a PhD and/or MD (i.e. level of education corresponding to the Danish PhD degree) for a  two-year position to commence on May 1, 2025.   About the groups  The Choudhary lab is technically and internationally diverse and embedded in an excellent environment that supports high-quality research and encourages interdisciplinary collaboration. The Choudhary lab conducts research using interdisciplinary, state-of-the-art technologies, including quantitative proteomics, next-generation nucleic acid sequencing, advanced microscopy, CRISPR-based genome editing, and bioinformatics. The lab uses diverse cell models, including embryonic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives.   Project description  Our group works in the broad area of proteomics, genomics, and cell signaling. In this project, we are interested in understanding the scope and function of lysine acetylation in gene regulation, as well as to understand the mechanisms of gene activation by cis-regulatory enhancers. The project will use quantitative proteomics and genomics to further understand the role of acetylation and other chromatin modifications in gene regulation. The project will combine CRISPR-based genome editing with NGS-based approaches (i.e. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq) and cell biological approaches to uncover new regulatory pathways and decipher underlying mechanisms.    The postdoc candidate will perform wet laboratory experiments involving cultured mammalian cells, creating CRISPR engineered cell lines, and generating NGS data, including high-quality ChIP-seq data. The candidates with experience in both wet lab and bioinformatics will be able to do both (i.e. work in the wet lab and perform bioinformatics analyses).   Start date : May 1, 2025.   Qualifications  The candidate should have demonstrated excellent scientific productivity, evidenced by high-quality research publications, be able to conduct independent and creative research, and show good interpersonal and communication skills.   • The candidate is required to have a PhD/MD level of education corresponding to the Danish PhD degree in natural or medical science.   • Excellent scientific track record, including at least one publication in a high-quality, peer-reviewed international journal. Pre-prints can be counted for fulfilling this requirement.   • Expert knowledge in one or more of the following areas is advantageous:   1.  Prior experience in the area of epigenetics, and gene transcription regulation.  2. Hands-on experience in generating high-quality ChIP-seq data is essential.  3. Hands-on experience in culturing mammalian cells.  4. Experience in molecular biology techniques, including use of CRISPR-based genome editing .   • Good communication skills, both oral and written.   • An analytical aptitude for devising innovative scientific or technical solutions.   For further information, please contact Professor Chunaram Choudhary, email:  chuna.choudhary@cpr.ku.dk     Place of employment and work  The employment is at CPR (www.cpr.ku.dk), University of Copenhagen, located in central Copenhagen. The Center comprises modern laboratories, supercomputer resources, and state-of-the-art research facilities. Denmark is often ranked as the happiest nation and Copenhagen is consistently ranked as one of the best cities for living.
