The project is part of the researcßh project “ReWork”, which is financed by the Innovation fund Denmark under DIREC.   Start date is (expected to be) 1.8.2022 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  Working remotely, and in hybrid work arrangements, is the future. ReWork focus on developing the “Futures of Hybrid Work”, where we will design and develop artefacts and processes to support organizations in exploring and preparing for successful collaboration in the future. Examples of investigations includes the role and representation of embodiment, artefact interaction, and physical surroundings in a digital/analog setting of hybrid cooperative work.   This PhD will utilize research-through-design strategies to explore how we can bring together artistic explorations and industrial insights to inform the design ofuture technologies supporting hybrid work practices. In particular, the PhD fellow will work closely together with ReWork artistic- and industry- partners in setting up and organizing several artist/industry workshops creating a creative space to challenge the future of hybrid work.   The PhD fellow is expected to thrive and contribute to a highly cooperative research environments across universities, PIs, and other PhD fellows in the ReWork project hired at ITU, Århus University, and RUC.
