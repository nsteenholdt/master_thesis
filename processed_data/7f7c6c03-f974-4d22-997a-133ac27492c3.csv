The PhD fellowship is part of the multidisciplinary research project COTRANSITION (COllectively TRANSITIONing the agriculture and food system), which is financed by the Plant-Based Food Foundation ( Fonden for Plantebaserede Fødevarer ).   Start date of the PhD fellowship is (expected to be) May 1st 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  By working with the Climate Alliance ( Klimaalliancen ) to support Danish regions and municipalities in reducing their GHG emissions and developing ambitious solutions for the future agriculture and food system, the overarching aim of the COTRANSITION project is to accelerate the transformation of the agri-food system in Denmark by overcoming barriers and lock-ins, and mobilizing agri-food stakeholders to collaborate on transitioning to more plant-based food production and consumption. The COTRANSITION project is a collaboration between IFRO and PLEN, the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences at UCPH, represented by Assoc. Prof. Christian Bugge Henriksen, who is the project coordinator. At IFRO, the project is lead by Prof. Anders Blok and Prof. Jørgen Dejgård Jensen.    The PhD project is part of the subproject “Mapping of stakeholder interests and analysis of lock-ins, barriers and potential drivers of change to a more plant-based agriculture and food system”. The PhD project contributes to this subproject by investigating economic drivers, barriers and lock-ins for transition in the agricultural and agri-food sectors at national, regional and local level, as well as to the development of transition scenarios for the Danish Agri-Food System. This entails using qualitative methods to map the relevant economic incentives, mechanisms and barriers on farms and in food industry firms, and in particular quantitative methods to assess the strength of incentives and the nature and magnitudes of barriers and lock-ins regarding transition towards a more plant-based agrifood sector, at the level of selected regions and municipalities and across the agri-food value chain. An example of a barrier could be farms’ recent investment in facilities for animal production.   The PhD fellow will be part of the interdisciplinary COTRANSITION project team, which will comprise a total of three PhD fellows, which besides the PhD in economics will include a PhD in scenario development and a PhD in agri-food system transition, as well as the three project leaders. Alongside joining and working closely with the COTRANSITION project team, the PhD Fellow will also benefit from being part of IFRO’s broader group of economists working with economic issues related to agriculture, food and the environment.
