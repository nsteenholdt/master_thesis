CST conducts research in different areas of natural language processing, digital humanities, and computational cognitive modelling, and hosts the Danish Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure (CLARIN);   https://clarin.dk/clarindk/forside.jsp  The Centre has a strong international profile, at the same time as pursuing the development of language technology resources for the Danish language.   The Natural Language Processing Section at (DIKU);  https://di.ku.dk/english/research/nlp/  provides a strong, international and diverse environment for research within core as well as emerging topics in natural language processing, natural language understanding, computational linguistics and multi-modal language processing. The successful candidate will join the CoAStaL- research group at DIKU part of their time; https://coastalcph.github.io/  “The Natural Language Processing” research environment at the University of Copenhagen is ranked 2nd in Europe according to CSRankings.   Job content    The postdoc will be part of two interconnected projects :  MeMo – Measuring Modernity: Literary and Social Change in Scandinavia 1870-1900 ,  funded by the Carlsberg Foundation (PI: Associate Professor Jens Bjerring-Hansen, NorS),  https://nors.ku.dk/english/research/projects/measuring-modernity/  and  Mining the Meaning: A semantic parsing approach to the study of literary change , funded by the UCPH Data+ pool, PIs: Associate Professor Jens Bjerring-Hansen and Assistant Professor Daniel Hershcovich, DIKU.   The projects aim to investigate semantic change in the so-called ‘Modern Breakthrough’ in Scandinavia 1870-1900, based on a digital corpus comprising some 900 Danish and Norwegian novels. We seek to deploy and develop Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques for literary analysis and to combine these with theoretical and historical expertise. This will allow for new insights into the processes of modernization in a formative period in the cultural, social, and political history of Scandinavia as well as for methodological innovation in the computational representation of robust semantic trends and patterns in historical texts.   The postdoc will adapt state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing models and language resources to historical, Danish language text, and apply them to detecting and measuring lexical semantic change. Furthermore, the postdoc will develop more abstract computational approaches to historical language change, informed by semantic parsing, event modeling and other methods.   The postdoc will work alongside the two PIs and will be highly involved in their research groups and teaching activities at NorS and at the Natural Language Processing section at DIKU. At NorS Professor Bolette S. Pedersen (Centre for Language Technology) will co-supervise the postdoc and assist in applying and adapting language resources.
