The project is part of the research project “Universal Growth Laws of Viruses of Bacteria”, led by Associate Professor Namiko Mitarai and financed by NERD Program, Novo Nordisk Foundation (for more information on the grant, see  https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/news/nerd-programme-provides-opportunities-for-creative-scientists-to-carry-out-original-research/). The project is focused on the viruses infecting bacteria, an ideal  in-vivo  model system to study the interplay between a virus and its host. At the same time, bacterial phages are drivers of microbial ecology, gene transfer and microbial evolution. We aim to explore the virus development upon infection as a dynamic and stochastic process exhibiting decisions. We are also actively studying the role of phages at the population scale and ecology scale and as pattern formation to macroscopic scale of epidemics as it spread in a 2 or 3 dimensional geometry. The strength of our research environment is the strong connection between experimental and theoretical research: We develop mathematical and computational models to mimic, suggest and perform experiments on these fascinating systems. We search for a creative and driven researcher who will thrive in this unique environment and ask new questions. The scientists with strong mathematical and computational skills in physics/complex systems who wants to extend their skills to biological experiments are strongly encouraged to apply. Alternatively, we seek a scientist with strong background in quantitative microbial experiments and single-cell experiments, who is enthusiastic about work environment with many theoretical ideas.
