Start date is (expected to be) 1 July 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  With this project we aim to investigate how autophagy modulates cellular reprogramming needed for plants to tolerate flooding stress. We will achieve this by combining state-of-the art microscopy, molecular, biochemical and genetic approaches.   Who are we looking for?  We are looking for candidates within the field(s) of Biology, Molecular Biology or related areas with significant laboratory experience. Ideally, the successful candidate will possess excellent skills in with life-cell imaging, cloning, and molecular biology techniques. Prior experience working with model plants species  Arabidopsis thaliana  and   Physcomitrium patens  will be considered an advantage. The candidate should hopefully be extremely enthusiastic about scientific research, proactive, imaginative and should be able to work independently and in a team.    Our group and research- and what do we offer?  Our group is interested in how plants cells execute reprogramming under new conditions, namely during development and stress adaptation. To achieve this, we  use a combination of genetic, cell and molecular biology approaches. We then apply our toolkit to distant model species to gain perspective on how these processes evolved in plants. We conduct curiosity-driven fundamental research with potential applicability to find solutions to create plants with enhanced productivity and tolerance to stress.   The group is a part of Department of Biology, Section for Functional Genomics, Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. The Section provides a strong, international environment for research in the field of Genetics and Genomics located at Copenhagen Biocenter, Ole Maaløes Vej 5, Copenhagen N. The Section currently employs 10 principal investigators, 4 technicians, 12 postdocs, 25 PhD students as well as several undergraduate students.
