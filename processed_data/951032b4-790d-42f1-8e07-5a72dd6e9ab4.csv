The position is available from 01 July 2025 or later. You can submit your application via the link under 'how to apply'. Title Remote Sensing for Climate-smart Agriculture Research area and project description Department of Agroecology at Aarhus University, Denmark, is offering a PhD position in remote sensing for climate-smart agriculture, starting 01 July 2025 or earliest possible thereafter. The position is available for a 3-year period. Food security, climate change and loss of biodiversity represent three of today’s major environmental sustainability challenges. Finding solutions to these challenges requires studies that extend across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The Pioneer Center Land-CRAFT was established in June 2022 to undertake fundamental and applied research that addresses these issues. The center brings together experts on climate impact research and process-based modelling of biogeochemistry, agronomy, biology and geography from Aarhus University and University of Copenhagen, as well as international partners. Field experiments, digital technologies -- including modelling and remote sensing, as well as interactions with stakeholders are key components of Land-CRAFT. Climate-smart agriculture aims to provide innovative solutions to improve crop production, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and strengthen agroecosystem resilience to climate extremes. Timely information of agroecosystem dynamics is highly important for understanding the complex interactions among crops, management activities and environmental factors. This project aims to develop novel remote sensing algorithms to monitor crop nitrogen and agroecosystem productivity for climate-smart agriculture. The remote sensing derived information will be used to inform climate-smart agriculture practices and policies for the Danish and EU wheat cropping systems. In this project, the PhD student will work on the following tasks. (1) To develop novel remote sensing algorithms to integrate soil-vegetation radiative transfer models and deep learning to quantify crop nitrogen and productivity from satellite remote sensing at the regional scale. (2) To assess the potential impacts of climate change and management practices on crop nitrogen, crop productivity, and nitrogen use efficiency. (3) To conduct data-driven analysis to identify optimal nitrogen fertilizer rates to maximimize crop productivity while minimizing negative negative impacts (greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient leaching). (4) To collaborate with stakeholders, including farmers, policymakers, and researchers for field data collection and research dissemination. This Ph.D. position offers an opportunity to collaborate inter-disciplinary with other scientists on cutting-edge research in remote sensing for climate-smart agriculture to enhance agroecosystem productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
