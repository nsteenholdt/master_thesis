Our group and research  The candidate will be part of the research group Excitable Cells and Biomechanics, IVH, UCPH led by main supervisor associate professor Kirstine Callø. The group is specialized in cardiac electrophysiology. Co-supervisor associate professor Kristine Freude is head of the Disease Stem Cell Models and Embryology research group, IVH, UCPH and in an expert in stem cell technology. Co-supervisor associate professor Johan Ulrik Lind, Tailored Materials and Tissues, Department of Health Technology and Biomimetics, Technical University of Denmark (DTU) has pioneered the use of multi-material 3D printing for generating complex cardiac tissue models.   Project description   The vast majority of stem cell-derived cardiac tissue models and organoids are based on human cell models. As the access to native human cardiac tissue is restricted, validation of hiPSC-CM is challenged and the predictive value of the hiPSC-CM based assays questionable. Pigs and dogs have served as the key large-animal test models for preclinical cardiac efficacy and toxicity for decades. We thus have access to a rich and varied data set that includes both safe and un-safe compounds. Matching whole-animal and ex vivo data against iPSC-based in vitro assays derived from the same species provides an appealing route toward validating organoid assays in general and thereby reduce and replace experimental animals.   Our core goal to establish 3D bio-printed porcine and canine cardiac organoids on gel-coated MEAs is broken down into three key objectives:     Establish canine and porcine iPSCs and optimize a cardiomyocyte differentiation protocols.   We will develop a procedure for 3D bio-printing anisotropic porcine and canine cardiac organoids directly onto gel-coated commercially available multiple electrode arrays (MEA) chips.   We will apply MEA electrodes for electrically stimulating tissue contractions to accelerate maturation, and will optimize gel composition, mechanics and thickness for enabling long-term, contractile maturation.   The MEAs are applied for quantitative assessment of tissue-level arrhythmic events in response to pharmaceutical treatments and results will be bench marked against results from native canine and porcine hearts.
