 The Department of Pathology at Zealand University Hospital, Denmark is looking for EU certified specialist in Pathology. 
 Perhaps you are looking for: 
 
 A god collegial atmosphere 
 A highly professional environment 
 Opportunities to develop your career in Pathology 
 Excellent work-life balance in a highly livable town just half an hour drive from Copenhagen 
 Assistance with relocation and Danish lessons etc. 
 
 A job with influence and team-based work 
 We are looking for medical specialists in pathology who want to make a difference, for both patients and colleagues, as well as in their field of expertise. We have openings for both consultants and unit specialists and can offer good opportunities to the right candidates. 
 The department of Pathology in Region Zealand covers most disciplines in pathology. We work in smaller teams divided by organ area, with some of our specialists working in a single team and others in multiple teams. Some teams are well staffed, some are in the middle of generational shift, and some needs to expand due to demand, we are therefore looking for new colleagues in several teams. As an example, the team of ENT/Oral Pathology is in the process of being established, and we are looking for new enthusiastic applicants that can bring new ideas to the process, and an interest in influencing the development of this area in the future. 
 A good balance of routine work and professional challenges and development 
 We have a busy working day with a good balance of routine work and exciting professional challenges, all in a good working atmosphere. Our focus is on ensuring quality and a good workflow. We have a large and growing molecular team that offers many opportunities. Clinical applicants across all teams work closely together, and we have a solid research base comprising many research staff and related projects. You will have the opportunity to participate in, or initiate, your own research projects. If you are interested in management, there are good opportunities to work towards this goal and develop it further. 
 Here is how our teams describe themselves :

 ENT/Oral pathology : 
A very versatile sub-specialty where you are faced with a wide range of diagnoses, tissue types and sample types. This is where rare birds are somewhat less rare and with a high level of professional ambition. We have a very good collaboration with regional clinics and professional colleagues in pathology. Experience within the sub-specialty would be an advantage, but qualifications such as interest, a can-do attitude and a cheerful disposition are also highly valued. 
 Our ENT/Oral pathology team consists of 1 full time experienced unit specialist which is head of the team as well as 1 unit specialist and 2 consultants who primarily work in other teams while simultaneously being trained in the area of ENT/Oral Pathology. 
 We receive biopsies and cytology from predominantly benign resectates from salivary glands, mouth, nose- and sinuses, pharynx, larynx, thyroid, neck and ears. Moreover, we receive frozen sections and cytology to be answered on the same day in order for the clinicians to be able to plan further treatment. Large parts of our samples are sent early in the process, where our role is to guide further tests and treatment often on sparingly material. 
 Skin pathology:   
A large and exciting area with a very wide range of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions, where we challenge systematic thinking and perform clinical detective work. The department receives samples from the Department of Plastic- and Breast Surgery, which requires rapid diagnostics of both frozen and cancer pathway samples, and samples from the Dermatology department and both specialist and general practices throughout the region. We have a close cooperation with both of the above-mentioned departments both in the form of conferences and research collaboration. Molecular biology also plays a role, along with other special investigations. 
 The team consists of 2 consultants and 1 unit specialist covering both neoplastic- and inflammatory skin lesions, together with 2 consultants primarily working in other teams covering neoplastic skin lesions.  
 Breast pathology:   
We are the second largest center for breast cancer diagnosis in Denmark. The team is involved in a dynamic and well-functioning collaboration with the other partners in the multidisciplinary group focusing on breast cancer (radiology, surgery, oncology, genetics). Like the other teams, we focus on professionalism and quality. We also prioritize commitment to development and research within the field of breast cancer and believe good and equal cooperation is essential for a well-functioning team. 
 The team consists of 2 consultants and 1 unit specialist, where the consultant which is head of the team is working as a part time researcher and part time in routine.  
 Besides the teams mentioned above we also have smaller openings in other teams as gynopathology, gastropathology and hematopathology. 
 An active and flexible work place with many career possibilities 
 You will be joining an active and professionally strong department that offers routine work, teaching/education, research, molecular biology and management development. We value flexibility for both the department and its employees. The department offers training for all professional groups (doctors, bio-analysts etc.) and believes participation in conferences and courses is necessary to develop and maintain a high professional standard.
