 In the broad perspective, CoaST supports development, production and use of high performance organic coatings. Working along the whole value chain our research activities cover organic, polymer based coating technologies from raw materials, over formulation, test and characterization to production and application.  
 
 Overall, our research is focused on improving the sustainability profile of heavy duty coatings, reducing the use of unwanted substances, facilitating the use of renewable raw materials, improving formulation and test methods through the use of mathematical modelling - we also focus on the invention of totally new types of coatings technology with superior performance or functionality.  
 
 Areas of our present research are e.g. anticorrosive coatings for steel structures, blade coatings for wind turbines, intumescent coatings for passive fire protection, fouling control coatings for ships and other constructions.  
 
 All of the coatings mentioned above use pigments. They are not just crucial for the coating appearance but also performance, e.g., zinc in corrosion protection or copper in antifouling coatings. The project will investigate and develop novel processes (e.g., aerosol synthesis) to design pigments with unique properties to save resources and enhance the coating performance.  
 
 PhD position 
 
 We are looking for very ambitious PhD candidates interested in working with us in our goal of improving the sustainability and performance of functional pigments. The project will mainly use high temperature aerosol processes for the pigment synthesis. The successful candidate should have a very hands-on attitude and keen interest in high temperature reactions, particle formation mechanisms, particle characterization techniques, and coating formulation and testing. The most promising pigments will also be integrated into coating formulations and exposed to various test environments. We welcome applications from high performing newly graduated graduates as well as from experienced people from industry having a strong desire to turn towards research.  
 
 Our working environment is international and intercultural. Our working language is English.  
 
 Qualifications 
 
 You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, or materials science and be able to handle and have an interest in the synthesis and characterization of particles.  
 
 Experience with coatings may be an advantage.  
 
 Approval and Enrolment 
 
 The scholarships for the PhD degree are subject to academic approval, and the candidates will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules  
 
 Assessment 
 
 The assessment of the applicants will be made by Professor Kim Dam-Johansen, Associate Professor Hao Wu, and Assistant Professor Jochen Dreyer.
