To commence as soon as possible.     About the LEO Foundation Skin Immunology Research Center (SIC)   SIC is located on the 12th floor in the award-winning Maersk Tower at the Department of Immunology and Microbiology. We offer ultra-modern facilities and a vibrant international research environment with focus on the development of early-career scientists. Based on a grant from the LEO Foundation of more than 50 million EUR, the center aims to unite leading Danish and international researchers in immunology and skin disease to provide new knowledge to enable better diagnostics and more effective treatments for a wide range of inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and eczema. Information about the center can be found at:  http://www.sic.ku.dk/     Our research  The postdoctoral studies will be performed in the Translational Skin Immunology laboratory at SIC, under the supervision of executive director of SIC, Professor Liv Eidsmo. Research in the Eidsmo lab focuses on the role of resident T cells during homeostasis and immunopathology in the human skin. The group has defined functional subsets of resident T cells and investigates how these cells interact within their natural microenvironment in health and disease (Cheuk, Immunity 2017 and Gallais-Serezal, JACI 2019). Our technical platform includes in vitro propagation and single cell sequencing of small skin derived populations, spatial transcriptomics, in vivo imaging, xenotransplant models and flow-based techniques.   The Eidsmo laboratory is physically divided between two sites, at the LEO Foundation Skin Immunology Center in Copenhagen, Denmark, and at the Center for Molecular Medicine, CMM, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. The two labs are collaborating closely, with joint lab meetings and journal clubs and hosts bioinformaticians, biologists, medical doctors, and support personnel.     Your job  We are looking for 1-2 postdocs for projects addressing basic mechanisms of T-cell driven focal immunopathology, including modulation or ablation of these cells as novel therapeutic strategies. The postdoc will work both independently, and as a collaborative and helpful team member. Fellows actively take part in research meetings, contribute to a well-functioning local research environment, and supervise other lab members. We provide a supportive environment for career development of independent scientists. The postdoc will participate in formulating and testing scientific hypothesis with experimental work, presentations and preparation of publications.     Profile   We are looking for a highly motivated and ambitious fellow with excellent theoretical background and practical experience in tissue and/or cellular immunology. Prior experience with humanized mouse models of inflammation, cellular immunology including flow cytometry, cell sorting, image stream or molecular biology including single cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics or imaging techniques, including in vivo imaging using two photon microscopy, will be highly valued.   The position requires dedication to the project, a high level of accuracy and attention to detail, and a strong desire to excel. A personal fit into the team and excellent communication skills in both spoken and written English is essential. A proactive and problem-solving attitude will be highly valued. The candidate must hold a PhD degree upon the start of this position.     Place of employment   The place of employment is at the LEO Foundation Skin Immunology Research Center, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen.
