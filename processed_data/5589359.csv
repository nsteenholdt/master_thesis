You use your well-developed communication skills to establish good working relations with all stakeholders. English is our main company language, so you’ll need to be comfortably fluent in both writing and speaking it too. 
   
 About what we offer 
 An exciting job in an international company with good professional and personal development opportunities, and where you influence the company´s further development. You’ll have a chance to listen to the music you love on some truly amazing speakers (including getting the opportunity to buy them at a pleasing discount), and even get to see behind the scenes on how they’re made, tested and designed in-house at the factory.
