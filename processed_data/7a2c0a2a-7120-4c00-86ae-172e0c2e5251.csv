The position is available from 1 July 2025 (or as soon as possible within 2025). You can submit your application via the link under 'how to apply'. Title: MEMS and metasurface for sustainable optical displays Research area and project description: Optical displays play a ubiquitous role in daily life, being an essential component of smartphones, computers, televisions, etc. However, these devices make up roughly half of the 50 million tons of e-waste produced globally every year. There is an urgent need for alternative display technologies which are easier to recycle and are financially feasible to be incorporated into sustainable consuming electronics. The project aims to develop a new environment friendly display technology based on MEMS (Microelectromechanical systems) and metasurface structural colours for consuming electronics. The proposed technology combines artificial designed structures for visible colours and MEMS micro cantilevers to realize full range RGB displays, while the devices use only few common earth-abundant materials, potentially able for cost effective products and ultra-fast optical display. Project description For technical reasons, you must upload a project description. Please simply copy the project description above and upload it as a PDF in the application. Qualifications and specific competences: Applicants must have a relevant Master’s degree (120 ECTS), or equivalent, or receive the Master’s degree before starting. The Master’s degree shall be in Electrical Engineering, Applied Physics, Physics, or Optical Engineering. It is preferred that the applicants Bachelor’s degree in the above fields as well. The project entails numerical simulations, micro- and nanofabrication (cleanroom), and electrical and optical characterization. The applicants should be willing to work with a wide range of experimental and theoretical topics. The applicants shall be able to work independely, as well as in a group.
