At the Photovoltaic Materials and Systems Group at DTU Fotonik, we work with emerging materials for photovoltaic applications. By joining the group you will work within novel n-type materials for the solar cells of the future.  
 
 At DTU Fotonik, we have many years of experience with the environmentally-friendly and non-toxic solar cell absorber material Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), both as a single-junction and as a part of a multi-junction solar cell. CZTS and many other thin-film solar cells use the toxic n-type material cadmium sulfide (CdS), which does not result in an optimal band alignment at the p-n interface for CZTS. The aim of this Ph.D. scholarship is to design new, tunable, Cd-free n-type materials, which can enhance the efficiency of emerging thin-film solar cells. The group at DTU Fotonik is world leading within tandem systems of solar cells with CZTS as the toplayer.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 You will be working on developing an n-type material with a tunable band gap and tunable conduction band and you will apply them in CZTS solar cells as well as other novel solar cell absorbers. You will contribute to the fabrication and characterization of the devices, as well as advanced characterization of the p-n interface.  
 
 Your primary tasks will be to: 
 Explore new n-type oxide materials that are deposited mainly by sputtering, but other deposition techniques such as solution-based methods or atomic layer deposition (ALD) could also be used  
 Investigate CZTS thin-film solar cells with the new n-type layers  
 Model the CZTS/n-type layer interface by a software such as SCAPS  
 Teach and supervise B.Sc. and M.Sc. student projects  
 Dissemination of scientific results to various audiences via different media (scientific journals, international conferences, etc.)  
 
 
 You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.  
 
 Approval and Enrolment 
 
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules  
 
 Assessment 
 
 The assessment of the applicants will be made by Researcher Sara Engberg, Senior Scientist Stela Canulescu, and Senior Researcher Eugen Stamate.  
 
 We offer 
 
 DTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice. We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment. We strive for academic excellence in an environment characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom tempered by responsibility.  
 
 Salary and appointment terms 
 
 The appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. The allowance will be agreed upon with the relevant union. The period of employment is 3 years. The starting date is as soon as possible.  
 
 The main workplace is DTU Risø Campus and occasionally at Lyngby Campus, and this position includes external stay(s) at our partner, FAU, University of Erlangen, in Germany.
