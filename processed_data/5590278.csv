Core research areas of  CBS LAW, Department of Management, Politics and Philosophy: CBS LAW is a leading institution for providing excellence in legal scholarship and one of the most dynamic scholarly environments within law in Northern Europe. CBS LAW’s main mission is to challenge and develop existing legal structures. In that sense, our research focuses on these structures, their setup, how they function, how they influence the society and what processes, in turn, influence their change. CBS LAW also aims to exercise influence on regulation, through providing high quality legal and multidisciplinary research, participating in policy initiatives, and laying the groundwork for future changes. Teaching responsibilities of the Department comprise undergraduate and graduate teaching in aspects of digitalization. The department provides research-based education in digitalization, covering both business and technical perspectives. CBS LAW is a constituent part of the Department for Management, Politics and Philosophy (MPP). Research area: Digital transformation, understood broadly as the integration of digital technology into business, brings with it the challenge of the understanding the relationship between regulation and digital business model and strategies. The project should, therefore, aim to provide understanding on how digital business models are regulated and second, how strategy is affected by such models of regulation. Examples of research areas that a scholarship might cover: Platform business models and law Legal innovation and law Blokchain and law Surveillance and surveillance capitalism Competition law and the digital world Telecommunications law Free speech regulation AI and Robotics Regulation and deregulation of digital power concentrations MPP provides critical and cutting-edge research in the humanities and social sciences.
