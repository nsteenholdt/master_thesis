A PhD at DTU Nanolab is a natural next step.  
 
 At DTU Nanolab you will break new ground at the absolute forefront of what is possible within the research fields of nanofabrication, materials discovery, and characterization. In a combined role (full time with full time salary), you will go through a researcher education while working on a research project. When finished, you have built valuable network, friendships as well as achieved research results to be proud of – and by that, you have created the best possible foundation for your future career in academia or industry.  
 
 DTU Nanolab are seeking a number of ambitious students to drive the PhD scholarships listed below. The intended starting date is September 1, 2022 but can be adjusted within a range of a few months upon mutual agreement.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 Your overall focus will be to strengthen the department's competences within the development of new materials, fabrication of nanostructured surfaces and devices as well as pushing the boundaries of (in situ) characterization of structural and spectroscopic characterization at the nanoscale.  
 
 You will work with nearby colleagues, and with both academic and industrial partners in Denmark as well as abroad. Your primary tasks will be to:  Acquire hands-on competences in Nanofabrication and Nanocharacterization and apply those for teaching and supervision of BSc and MSc students;  
 Depending on the nature of the project, develop beyond-state-of-the-art nanofabrication processes and/or advanced nanostructure characterization methods;  
 Determine structural phenomena (and their statistical relevance); as well as the link to specific properties;  
 Synthesize novel materials and/or nanostructures, and/or explore their structure-property relationships;  
 
 
 Characteristics: 
 You are interested in working in interdisciplinary research collaboration;  
 You are a team player and have a strong talent for interacting in teams and integrating information;  
 You have a fundamental interest in nanostructures, materials, nanofabrication, structure-property relations, and materials characterization;
