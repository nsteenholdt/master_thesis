The position is for 30 months, with start  1 September 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The Project    The vision of the PROFERMENT project is to build the scientific foundation for future development of a new category of proteinaceous, plant-based foods as clean-label alternatives for meat consumption. Using solid-state fermentation, the proteins in legumes and cereals will be nutritionally optimized and appealing structures and flavours created.   By 2050, about 50% more food is needed to feed the world. Increasing the amount of plant based foods in the diet and thereby reducing meat consumption is one way to secure sufficient food availability in the future and at the same time combat climate change. One-third of global arable land is now being used to grow feed for livestock production and the calories used by feeding the animals could theoretically feed 4 billion people more.   Solid-state fermentation, the gentle and natural method used in PROFERMENT combining  Bacillus  bacteria and selected types of moulds, will be explored in-depth to provide new knowledge on how to improve protein digestibility and quality of plant foods, build filamentous structures and generate desirable flavours. Yellow peas and oats are the main plant food models used, both are primarily used for animal feed and have a relatively high protein content.   A major challenge of proteinaceous plant-based foods, as new food alternatives, is to deliver high palatability to consumers. Foods derived from animal origin possess unique savoury flavours and tangible textures, which originate from muscle tissues, enzymatic processes and thermal treatment during food preparation. Fresh plants and seeds do not possess such savoury dimensions and their textures need significant modification to become attractive alternatives for consumers.    The post doc duties  will be to address the enzymatic pathways involved in the formation of small peptides (γ-glutamyl derivatives) with savoury taste enhancing and enriching properties that are expressed by fungal and Bacillus strains used in solid-state fermentation.   Specific tasks for the postdoc position:     Monitor the development of γ-glutamyl peptides during fermentation   Identification of key enzymes in the generation γ-glytamyl peptides during fermentation   Evaluate the influence of the growth media on the gerneration of γ-glytamyl peptides   Sensory investigation of the inpact of the γ-glytamyl peptides     Required qualifications:      A PhD degree in biology, biochemistry, molecular biology or biotechnology.   Documented experience with targeted LC-MS analysis for γ-glytamyl peptides   Practical experience with enzyme kinetics   Pratical experience with fermentation   Experience with sensory evaluation of kokumi       Key selection criteria:     Professional qualifications relevant for the position.
