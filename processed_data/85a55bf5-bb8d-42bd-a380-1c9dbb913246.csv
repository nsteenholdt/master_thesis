 Les Deux is built on three pillars: Entrepreneurship, Community, and Legacy. 
 We stay hungry: many dream of success, but only a few go and make it happen. 
We stay together: we’ve only got to where we are because of our people. 
We stay humble: we give back through charitable projects. 
 Our ambitions are big, and with our talented and passionate team, we know we can make them a reality. 
 Join us.  
   
 The Role 
 You bring our brand’s story to life through passion and creativity and connect with our audience. If fashion fuels your creativity, storytelling drives your passion, and crafting scroll-stopping content is your talent, we want to hear from you! 
 In this role, you’ll create visually engaging and impactful content that goes beyond showcasing our clothing—it’s about sparking a conversation and building a community. From Instagram to TikTok and beyond, you’ll work closely with our marketing and creative teams to inspire our audience, transform ideas into powerful campaigns that resonate deeply with our audience, and make a lasting impact. 
   
 What You’ll Be Doing 
 
 Plan, produce, and edit high-quality content (videos, reels, TikToks, etc.) that aligns with the brand’s aesthetic and goals. 
 Collaborate with the marketing and creative teams to conceptualize and execute campaigns and product launches. 
 Stay ahead of content trends in fashion, social media, and culture to create timely, engaging material. 
 Manage the content creation process from brainstorming ideas to publishing across platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube, etc.) together with our Social Media Specialist. 
 Work with models, stylists, and photographers to capture visually stunning content that highlights our products. 
 Analyze content performance and adjust strategies to maximize engagement and growth. 
 
   
 What You Offer: 
 You’re a creative storyteller with a great sense of humor. Translating ideas into visually stunning content that grabs attention and leaves a lasting impression is very natural to you. As a self-starter, you’re comfortable taking the reins and driving projects forward independently, but you’re also a team player who knows the value of collaboration and can follow directions. 
 You stay ahead of trends, bringing fresh ideas to the table and turning them into campaigns that inspire and connect with audiences. For you, content is more than just visuals—it’s about building a sense of community through impactful storytelling.  
 We are also looking for someone who has: 
 
 4+ years of professional content creation experience, ideally within the fashion or lifestyle industry. 
 Proficiency in video editing software, with a strong grasp of storytelling through visuals. 
 In-depth knowledge of social media platforms, algorithms, and the latest trends. 
 Exceptional storytelling skills, paired with a keen eye for detail and aesthetics. 
 Proven ability to handle multiple projects in a dynamic, fast-paced environment. 
 Experience with influencer collaborations and user-generated content (UGC) campaigns. 
 Familiarity with mirrorless cameras and a documentary-style approach to storytelling, where narrative is paramount. 
 Skill in color grading, both independently and using plugins to create visually striking content. 
 
 If there are a couple of things from this list that you feel you’re missing, please do apply anyway. A passion for learning and a great personality is just as important to us as experience. 
   
 What we offer 
 Our culture is one of the key reasons that we’ve grown from two people with a side project to an international brand with a team of 100, so retaining a friendly, vibrant, and down-to-earth atmosphere is crucial to us for the future. 
 We also offer 
 
 Salary matching your experience and competencies 
 Professional development opportunities to help you improve your skillset. 
 Six weeks of vacation each year 
 Company lunch scheme  
 Optional pension scheme and Health Insurance  
 Gym & basketball court at the office 
 Free workout sessions on Thursdays with a personal trainer 
 Friday bars and regular company socials 
 Great prices on our clothes and accessories 
 Free fruit, snacks, and most importantly, coffee (our coffee guy recently called our machine “The Ferrari of coffee machines”)  
 
   
 How to apply 
 If the above sounds like you then we want to hear from you! 
 We believe that difference makes us stronger, and encourage everyone to apply regardless of age, ethnicity, ability, gender, gender expression, gender identity, nationality, race, religion, or sexual orientation. 
 We’ll be reviewing applications on an ongoing basis. Snoozing = losing.
