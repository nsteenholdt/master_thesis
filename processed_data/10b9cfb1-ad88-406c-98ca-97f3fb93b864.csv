The PhD scholarship is to be filled by September 1st, 2025, or as soon as possible thereafter.     Framework   This call is for a 3 year fully funded PhD Scholarship integrated within Centre for Interior Studies under Institute of Architecture and Design at the Royal Danish Academy – Architecture, Design, Conservation and in collaboration with The Hirschsprung Collection. The scholarship is funded by the New Carlsberg Foundation. The PhD student will be enrolled at the Royal Danish Academy’s PhD school and will be supervised by Associate Professor in exhibition and interior design Ane Pilegaard and Curator at The Hirschsprung Collection, Art Historian, PhD Rasmus Kjærboe.      General Project Summary   The overall aim of the project will be to investigate the intimate, affective and home-like art gallery spaces that arose at the same time as – and as a response to – the modern universal museum. The furnished, often initially private, art museum and picture gallery with home-like interior décor, form an important counter-category to the large, public museums that were established in large numbers in the decades around 1900. The project will examine the intimate gallery as an important historical museum space category and, furthermore, explore its potential within contemporary and future exhibition design and museum architecture.     PhD Focus   The intimate gallery has several roots: in the Princely chambers and study collections, in the early commercial picture galleries and art associations, and in the private collections established within the homes of the bourgeoisie in the 18th century. Sir John Soane’s Museum in London (1837) is an early example of the fusion between home and museum, and many other examples exist across Europe and the United States. With an outset in The Hirschsprung Collection as the project’s primary case, the research will explore the intimate gallery as a museum space category from a national and/or international perspective. Thus, involving supplementary cases from within the Danish and, preferably, international museum landscapes.   The project should address following questions:     What characterizes the intimate gallery as a museum space category as it evolved from approx. 1850 to 1950 – seen from a historical, typological, aesthetical and possibly phenomenological and/or functional perspective?       How can the intimate gallery be understood within contemporary museum practice, and how can it inspire future museum practice and design?     The project combines a historical and contemporary focus. However, it is possible to place more emphasis on one over the other. For instance, the project can take an outset in the historical perspective by basing its research on archive studies, while also relating the research results to contemporary museum practice and design. Or the project can evolve around practice-based research, for instance in relation to contemporary exhibition making at The Hirschsprung Collection, while also contextualizing the research historically. These are just examples of how the project may be contrived.     Eligibility criteria     You must hold an educational degree equivalent to a Danish master’s degree (180 ECTS/3 FTE BSc + 120 ECTS/2 FTE MSc) in spatial design, architecture, art history or museology or other degree of equivalent relevancy is required, and conducted studies must include the area of exhibition and museum design/architecture. It is an advantage if you are able to read/learn to read Danish in order to include text documents on The Hirschsprung Collection’s original design in the project.   If you have completed an educational degree abroad, it will be assessed by the Danish Agency for International Education before enrolment and employment can take place. The Royal Danish Academy will assist with the assessment process if you are selected for the scholarship. Practical information can be found at  http://ufm.dk/en/education-and-institutions/recognition-and-transparency/recognition-guide .
