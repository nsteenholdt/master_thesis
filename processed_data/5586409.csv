Information about the research group can be found  here   Our research  The main research focus of the Clinical Proteomics Group, headed by Professor Matthias Mann, is to apply mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics to understand human health and disease. The study of the proteome could improve patient diagnosis and stratification and possibly prevent diseases such as metabolic disorders and cancer. To this end, the lab is developing and applying cutting-edge MS-based proteomics techniques, an area in which the Mann Group is world-leading.   The Mann Group undertakes ambitious research projects involving proteomics of archived tissue specimens and body fluids for patient phenotyping. One goal is to establish robust, high-throughput proteome profiling pipelines for these patient materials, allowing for the proteomic interrogation of large clinical cohorts. The group’s overarching aim is to identify protein markers for early detection of diseases such as diabetes and cancer, to improve diagnosis, and help to develop individualized therapies.   The Bioinformatics team is located both at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry and at Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research and uses cutting-edge technology to research bioinformatic challenges in mass spectrometry-based proteomics.
