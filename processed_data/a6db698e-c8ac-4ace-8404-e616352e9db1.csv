Our group and research   Our vision   is to stop the chronic inflammation and break the immune privilege (tolerance) of T cell cancer in the skin.  Our goal  is to discover novel molecular disease targets, innovative therapies, and ways to modify the immune system to fight disease.  Our mission  is to unravel how disturbances in the immune defense and bacterial infections lead to disease progression and how this knowledge can be utilized for better treatment and eventually cure of this potentially fatal disease.   We perform basic and translational research and have a close collaboration with clinicians at dermatology departments in Denmark, EU, and USA. We take an interdisciplinary approach to science and are collaborating with a large national and international network of researchers in areas such as immunology, microbiology, pharmacy, bioinformatics, cancer biology and veterinary and clinical medicine. We believe in teamwork and have an inclusive and supportive working environment in an international, open-minded atmosphere with a diversity of nationalities among group members and at the Department at large.     Project description  The specific research/project(s) that the postdoc will work on concerns the interplay between malignant T cells, the tumour microenvironment, and bacterial infection. The project will encompass isolation of primary malignant T cells and stromal cells, tissue culture and cell lines as well as 3D artificial skin models for functional studies and bacterial characterization, culturing, and influence on malignant cells, (other) immune cells, and stromal cells such as keratinocytes. This will be combined with advance flowcytometry, Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq), QPCR, ImmunoHistoChemistry (IHC) IF and Confocal microscopy, and other imaging technologies as well as genetic and biochemical methodologies.
