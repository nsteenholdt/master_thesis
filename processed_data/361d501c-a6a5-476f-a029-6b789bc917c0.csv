In one of these there is the option of being part of the development of a new MSc course.   The start date is (expected to be) 1 June 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The programme   The newly established Novo Nordisk Foundation Quantum Computing Program (NQCP), funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, is building a talented and diverse international team to create a cutting-edge program in the heart of Copenhagen, Denmark. At the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, where the formulation of Quantum Mechanics was born 100 years ago, the ambition is to build a mission-driven full-stack approach which will involve exciting innovations at every level, from the quantum processor to the quantum-classical interface all the way quantum algorithms and applications. The vision of the programme is to enable the development of fault-tolerant quantum computing hardware and quantum algorithms that solve important problems in the life-sciences.   The project   In the Theory and Simulation (T&S) team, we develop the computational methods and capabilities nessecary to realize hardware for practical quantum computing. For this purpose, we employ multiscale modelling and simulate at scales ranging from the atomic to the full device scale. In our work, we are collaboring closely with all of the different teams at NQCP, see https://nqcp.ku.dk/.   We are looking for up to three motivated PhD candiates to undertake research within large scale simulation of quantum systems. We are interested in developing a project plan with prospective candidates to best match their skills and experience to the activities in the T&S team. We imagine that the candidates would undertake research within one or more of the following topics:     Transduction of quantum information   Material simulations   Designs of advanced quantum chips   Light-matter interactions       Please note that one of the PhD projects will include the option to be part of developing modules for a new course on Large Scale Simulations of Quantum Systems. Therefore, please indicate in the application whether you would be interested in this.    Who are we looking for?   We seek motivated candidates with a master’s degree in Physics, Computational Physics, Quantum information, or Photonics specializing in theoretical and/or computational quantum physics. Succesful candidates will have:     Strong analytical and computational skills   A passion for developing theoretical protocols   Ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a dynamic research environment     Our group and research- and what do we offer?   We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in dynamic and international research environment hosted by the NNF Quantum Computing Programme (NQCP) at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen.   Currently, there are 21 PhD students at NQCP and a range of social activities are continuously going on. In addition to a world class research environment, you will therefore also become part of a thriving social environment.     The project will be supervised by Assistant Professor Mark Kamper Svendsen ( mark.svendsen@nbi.ku.dk  ), T&S team lead. The principal supervisor will be Associate Professor Stefano Paesani ( stefano.paesani@nbi.ku.dk ) or Associate Professor Kasper Grove-Rasmussen (  k_grove@nbi.ku.dk  ).         The PhD programme    Qualifications needed   To be eligible for the regular PhD programme, you must have completed a degree programme, equivalent to a Danish master’s degree (180 ECTS/3 FTE BSc + 120 ECTS/2 FTE MSc) related to the subject area of the project, e.g. a degree in Physics, Applied Physics, Photonics, Quantum Information or similar. For information of eligibility of completed programmes, see  General assessments for specific countries  and  Assessment database .   Terms of employment   Employment as PhD fellow is full time and for maximum 3 years.   Employment is conditional upon your successful enrolment as a PhD student at the PhD School at the Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. This requires submission and acceptance of an application for the specific project formulated by the applicant.
