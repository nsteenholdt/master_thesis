Nielsen at the Danish Center for Ultrahigh-Field NMR spectroscopy. The center is housed at the Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO) at Aarhus University. The position is funded by Aarhus University Research Foundation. Project Goals and Tasks The project seeks to combine excellence in pulse sequence design (theory, software) with low-field DNP equipment with fast waveform generation and/or high-field dissolution DNP to design experiments moving the boundaries for dynamic nuclear polarization in terms of sensitivity and information content. Your task is: Development of rf/microwave pulse sequences for DNP Implement and demonstrate the methods in instrumentally feasible experimental procedures Apply the methods to obtain insight into molecular structure/function in practice Qualifications and conditions of employment Applicants should hold a PhD degree in chemistry or physics with specialization in NMR, EPR, MRI or similar. The ideal candidate will have demonstrated experience in pulse sequence engineering, but also other profiles with a good understanding of the theory underlying magnetic resonance and applications will be considered. It is also relevant that the candidate has experience in programming, e.g., matlab or similar, and experiments. The postdoc will be part of a research team working on solid-state NMR and DNP method development and applications, implying that in addition to proven individual scientific excellence a collaborative mindset and good skills in English (oral and written) is required. The candidate should be independent, creative, and dependable. Minor involvement in teaching activities may be solicited. Research environment The Danish Center for Ultra High Field NMR Spectroscopy at Aarhus University offers a stimulating research environment, covering complementary research activities in the area of liquid-state NMR, solid-state NMR, high-field MRI, hyperpolarization (DNP and parahydrogen), and low-field NMR. The lab is equipped with state-of- the-art spectrometers operating at 950 MHz, 700 MHz, 500 MHz, and 400 MHz. The NMR research is embedded within the Department of Chemistry (  chem.au.dk ) and the Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (  inano.au.dk ). Aarhus University provides a strong international research and training environment with excellent professional and private conditions. Foreign employees can get help and information from the AU International Center (  au.dk/en/internationalcentre ) and Work in Denmark (  workindenmark.dk ). Tax reduction schemes for researchers may apply.
