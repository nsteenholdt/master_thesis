The project is funded by Partnerskab for Børneforskning, which was established by the Ministry of Education and Research in 2022 to support research on children’s wellbeing, learning and development in ECECs in Denmark. The position is full-time (37 hours/week) for a duration of 24 months, starting on 1 September 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter. The position will be based at the Department of Educational Anthropology and Educational Psychology at DPU at Campus Emdrup, Copenhagen NV.  The research project Care is essential for young children’s wellbeing and development and is considered a core value to pedagogues in Danish ECECs. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to place care on the political, pedagogical and theoretical agenda. Acknowledging that care in ECECs is undertheorised and a complex practice, this project aims to investigate the care pedagogy in ECEC settings and within preservice training of pedagogues. Through ethnographic research, participatory research (research circles), intervention and theoretical development, the project, among other things, seeks to investigate how care: •    Unfolds within complex social and cultural pedagogical settings •    Is shaped by institutional conditions •    Is reflected, not only as a dyadic practice (1:1) but also as a polyadic practice. The project is based on a research collaboration between DPU, Roskilde University and University College Copenhagen and consists of two broad work packages (WP): (1) Identification and strengthening of care pedagogy in 11 ECECs and (2) Enhancing a care pedagogy in the pedagogue’s Bachelor’s degree programme at University College Copenhagen. The research collaboration is an interdisciplinary initiative led by a research team with expertise in didactics, educational psychology and childhood studies. The project’s overall research question is:  How can a care-centred ECEC pedagogy be researched and enhanced in preservice pedagogue training and ECEC settings to foster children’s well-being and development? Read more about the project  here . The position The primary tasks of the postdoc are, in collaboration with Associate Professor Lone Svinth (PI) and Associate Professor Ditte Winther-Lindqvist, to specify, plan and carry out (1) participatory research (research circles) and (2) ethnographic research in relation to WP1.  Participatory research (research circles)  The selected applicant is expected to contribute to and engage with the participatory research, which consists of two sets of four research circles. Researchers will collaborate with pedagogues and leaders from the 11 ECECs in two sets of four half-day sessions, with the aim of developing new care practices, theories and criteria for a context-sensitive and practice-relevant care pedagogy. In the research circles researchers will facilitate an investigation of how pedagogues and leaders can develop a care-centred pedagogy that considers social and institutional conditions, thereby promoting children’s well-being and development. The postdoc is expected to analyse and disseminate their research in peer-reviewed journals. Ethnographic research The ethnographic research investigates how care for the child’s  wellbeing here and now  and care for the child’s development over time are practiced in ECECs, and how pedagogues experience the relationship between these two types of care. We expect the analysis to include how institutional and social/collegial conditions shape and influence these different care processes. This research element includes 1) participant observations in 11 ECECs (located in two municipalities on Sjælland), 2) interviews with pedagogues from the 11 ECECs, and 3) analyses and dissemination of the research in peer-reviewed journals. The 11 ECECs have already been selected, and Lone Svinth has conducted observations and interviews in the settings from autumn 2024 to spring 2025.   In addition to fulfilling these obligations, the postdoc is expected to: Be an active collaboration partner in the research group Be the first author on two peer-reviewed research articles in relevant Danish and international peer-reviewed journals Initiate and organise activities with Lone Svinth and Ditte Winther-Lindqvist (initiate, co-organise and participate in conferences, seminars and webinars as well as other relevant activities) Collaborate with the international advisory board Contribute to the popular dissemination of research findings. Qualifications The successful applicant for the postdoctoral position must hold a PhD or equivalent qualifications in psychology, educational psychology, anthropology or a related field within the humanities or social sciences. Applicants who have submitted their PhD dissertation and have been notified that it has been accepted for defence will also be considered qualified to apply. Furthermore, applicants must be able to document: Solid experience in planning and carrying out ethnographic field work along with analytical use of preferably sociocultural theory.  Apart from empirical investigation, analysis and dissemination in relevant international journals, the postdoc is expected to take part in coordinating the project on a daily basis with the PI. The methods applied are qualitative and participatory, focusing on professional development through research circles and ethnographic fieldwork. The theoretical sources of inspiration comprise phenomenological, cultural-historical, developmental, ethical and dialectical approaches to care and children’s being and becoming through participation in pedagogical activities and relationships in ECEC. It will be considered an advantage if applicants can also document professional experience with: •    ECEC •    Developmental psychology •    Relational care ethics •    Professional development •    Participatory research methodology •    Interdisciplinary collaboration in research teams •    Process facilitation in groups. As part of the application, applicants are asked to explain how their previous research experience and qualifications are relevant to the position (1 page).
