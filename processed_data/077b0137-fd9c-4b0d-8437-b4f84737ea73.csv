 Privacy issues in Machine Learning and Data Science  - Fully erasing the influence of the data requested to be deleted is challenging since, aside from simply deleting it from databases where it’s stored, it also requires erasing the influence of that data on other artifacts such as trained machine learning models. It is known that in some cases, it may be possible to infer with high accuracy whether an example was used to train a machine learning model. This can raise privacy concerns, as it implies that even if an individual's data is deleted from a database, it may still be possible to infer whether that individual's data was used to train a model. Contact: SDU Applied AI and Data Science, Head of Unit, Esmaeil S. Nadimi ( esi@mmmi.sdu.dk )

 Privacy issues in Machine Learning and Data Science  - Fully erasing the influence of the data requested to be deleted is challenging since, aside from simply deleting it from databases where it’s stored, it also requires erasing the influence of that data on other artifacts such as trained machine learning models. It is known that in some cases, it may be possible to infer with high accuracy whether an example was used to train a machine learning model. This can raise privacy concerns, as it implies that even if an individual's data is deleted from a database, it may still be possible to infer whether that individual's data was used to train a model.
