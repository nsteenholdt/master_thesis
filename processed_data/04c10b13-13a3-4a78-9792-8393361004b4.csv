 Collaborate with partners within the DRC-1 project (this will include traveling abroad). 
 Perform some limited teaching and other departmental duties. 
 
 Additionally, the requirements are:  
 
 You will conduct theoretical research on geometric singular perturbation theory in the context of slow-fast analytic vector fields. A degree in (applied) mathematics (or a degree with a solid foundation in mathematics) is required, ideally with experience in dynamical systems theory and the ability to critically engage with technical research papers. Prior knowledge of geometric singular perturbation theory or complex analytic techniques (e.g. relating to exponentially small phenomena) is an advantage, but all candidates with strong analytical skills and the capacity to quickly master advanced concepts are encouraged to apply.
