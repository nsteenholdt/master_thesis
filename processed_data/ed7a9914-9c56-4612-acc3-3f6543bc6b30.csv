The project will be conducted within the LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery, which combines expertise in physical chemistry, pharmaceutics, and bioengineering to advance research and develop innovative solutions in cutaneous drug delivery for both small and large molecules.   The successful applicant will have the opportunity to engage in cross-disciplinary research alongside other members of the Center, our collaborators at DTU Health tech, as well as undertake a potential research visit at Georgia Institute of Technology, USA.   Project description  Overcoming the skin barrier remains a persistent challenge, despite decades of research. The outermost layer of the skin, known as the stratum corneum (SC), serves as the primary barrier through a densely packed multilayer of corneocytes surrounded by lipids. However, transdermal drug delivery presents a significant opportunity in medical practice, offering not only localized treatment but also serving as an attractive alternative to oral delivery and injectables due to its ease of administration and patient compliance.   To fully harness the potential of cutaneous drug delivery, it is essential to comprehend the physicochemical properties of the applied drug delivery systems (DDS), the skin barrier, and the interfacial interaction between them, including their biological implications. Despite ongoing research, a substantial knowledge gap persists regarding how the physicochemical properties of the skin correlate with cutaneous drug delivery and specific DDSs.   Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of ionic liquids (ILs) to enhance skin permeability, attributed to their unique ionic constituents and composition. ILs can induce lipid extraction and/or fluidization of the stratum corneum, thereby improving drug transport across the skin barrier. In this PhD project, we aim to further advance the use of ILs as a cutaneous drug delivery strategy by integrating them with microneedle technology. Microneedles offer a minimally invasive approach to bypass the outermost skin barrier, creating microchannels that facilitate drug delivery while maintaining patient comfort.     Using a combination of biophysical tools, we will investigate the interplay between the solution structure of ILs, their interaction with the skin barrier, and their synergy with microneedle-mediated delivery. The project will provide critical insights into how the structural composition and drug load of ILs influence skin permeability, both independently and in combination with microneedles. This research aims to unlock the full potential of ILs for microneedle-assisted transdermal delivery, paving the way for efficient and targeted therapeutic applications.     The successful candidate will become a member of the LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery. This project focuses on: (i) analyzing the self-assembled structural properties of IL formulations as drug delivery carriers, (ii) evaluating the transdermal drug delivery potential of ILs, both independently and in combination with microneedles, and refining formulations for optimal performance, and (iii) conducting biological immunomodulatory testing to assess therapeutic efficacy. This project is part of the ILnext initiative funded by the LEO Foundation Dr. Abildgaard grant, and the selected candidate will collaborate closely with both PhD students and postdoctoral researchers associated with the project.
