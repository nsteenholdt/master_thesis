Anders Garm at the Marine Biological Section, University of Copenhagen. The postdoc will be part of a Danish Research Council financed project testing the hypothesis that some single celled organisms have image forming eyes and thus proper vision. The position is open from 1st of September 2025   or as soon as possible thereafter.   Project description   A special family of the single celled dinoflagellates, the warnowiaceans, possesses an organelle, which structurally resembles a camera-type eye. This organelle called the ocelloid is a modified chloroplast and contains a lens-like hyalosome and a retinula flanked by screening pigment. Our optical measurements show that the hyalosome does form an image on the retinula with a spatial resolution of approximately 10 degrees, which will likely allow the mixo-trophic dinoflagellate to detect potential prey items at distances up to 0.5 mm. The project thus seeks to finally prove that the image information is used to control the behavior of the dinoflagellates. It will be a comparative study including several species of warnowiaceans. The project will also examine how a single cell can process the image information putatively coming from the ocelloid. The work will happen in collaboration with the vision group at Lund University and the UAS center at University of Southern Denmark.              Main tasks of the postdoc     Participate on field trips to collect warnowiaceans from Denmark, the Mediterranean and other places both for experimental work and for initiating cultures    Conduct experiments testing visually guided behaviours of the dinoflagellates   Perform ultra-high resolution electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction of the ocelloid   Use a range of different image techniques to visualize the cellular structures      Scientific environment   The Garm lab offers creative and stimulating work conditions in a dynamic and international research environment, including modern lab-facilities. We study the structure and function of sensory organs and how the information they pick up is processed and turned it into behaviour. Most of the time, we study the eyes and vision of marine invertebrates such as box jellyfish, starfish, annelids and crustaceans, but we have also worked on mechano-, chemo-, electro- and magnetoreception, respectively. We use a multiangled approach to study these systems; the key methods we use are electrophysiology (intra and extracellular), microscopy (LM, TEM, SEM, and CLSM), culturing, behaviour ( in situ  and  in vitro ) and transcriptomics.   Qualifications    We are looking for a motivated and ambitious researcher with experience in vision research. Applicants with the following qualifications are preferred:     PhD degree in neuroethology, vision research, dinoflagellate ecology or equivalent.   Experience with the following is considered an advantage:  	   Experimental vision research.                 Bio-imaging including immunocytochemistry and in vivo labelling.   3D reconstruction based on serial sections.       Proficiency in English – both written and spoken.   Experience mentoring students in the lab.    Motivated to work in a multidisciplinary research team, as well as independently, with an open communication style and a problem-solving attitude.     The postdoc’s duties will include research within neurobiology, supervision of students, as well as (limited) teaching. The position may also include performance of other duties.
