Join our team at the University of Copenhagen as a Postdoctoral Fellow, where you'll contribute to the development of  BrainSTEM.org , an innovative platform for neurophysiological research.   Position overview  We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow for a project focused on developing BrainSTEM. BrainSTEM is a structured electronic lab notebook for describing neurophysiological experiments, as well as a collaboration and data-sharing platform for the community. The research will take place at the  Department of Neuroscience  at the University of Copenhagen in the lab of Dr. Peter C. Petersen ( PetersenLab.org ), in collaboration with  NYULH Neuroscience Institute . You will be part of a diverse, interdisciplinary team of neuroscientists and work with software developers and data scientists to push the boundaries of open science and neuroscience research.   Position responsibilities  The postdoc position focuses on the development of BrainSTEM. Responsibilities include:     Continuing the development of the relational standard language database model for describing experimental neuroscience.   Developing semantic search functionality.   Coding and implementation in Python/Django.   Collaborate on integration with other Open Science tools, such as the Neurodata without Borders standard and the DANDI repository.   Stimulate and support community uptake.     This project is primarily funded by the NIH, through the  BRAIN Initiative U19 Oxytocin grant . The role includes occasional travel to scientific meetings and pilot user labs.   Our research  Founded in 2022, our lab studies memory and cognition in rodent models and supports open science. We focus on spatial memory and theta oscillations in behaving rats, using state-of-the-art methods for measuring and manipulating neuronal activity at large scale and high specificity, along with advanced data analysis. Our tools include Neuropixels and other high-density silicon probes, optogenetics, thermal and other perturbation techniques, and population-analysis methods. The candidate will collaborate closely with experimentalists to ensure BrainSTEM’s development meets user needs.   We have developed several popular open science tools and solutions for the neuroscience community, including  CellExplorer , which has been cited more than 100 times, and are now developing BrainSTEM ( BrainSTEM.org ). The ultimate goal of BrainSTEM is to make neuroscience open and FAIR, promote collaborations, break down barriers between labs, and establish BrainSTEM as the preferred platform for describing and sharing experimental work within and across labs.   Candidate profile  We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic scientist with the following competencies and experience:   Essential experience and skills     PhD in Neuroscience, Software Engineering, Data Science, or related sciences.   Proficiency in programming, data analysis, and visualization using Python.   Highly self-motivated with the ability to work independently.   Proficient communication skills and ability to work in teams.   Excellent English skills, both written and spoken.   Experience with or an active interest in learning more about Neurophysiology.   Willingness to travel and flexibility with scheduling of working hours     Desirable experience and skills     Experience with the Django web framework or relational databases.   Experience with open science tools.   Experience in machine learning, large language models, and semantic search.   Aptitude for learning new programming languages or methods.   Knowledge of in-vivo electrophysiological experiments or imaging methods.   Knowledge of task development and behavioral data collection.     Place of employment  You will be employed at the Department of Neuroscience, University of Copenhagen in the center of Copenhagen. The successful applicant will join a thriving international neuroscience environment. We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in a dynamic and international research environment.     The applicant will be the major participant in all aspects of the project, from designing, developing, and implementing the technical solutions, to performing community outreach, working with pilot groups across the neuroscience community, and presenting results at conferences. Please contact  petersen.peter@sund.ku.dk  with questions and comments, or go to  PetersenLab.org  for more information.
