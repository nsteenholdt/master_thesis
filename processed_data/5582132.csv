The position will be vacant from 15 June 2022, or as soon as possible thereafter, and is for a 2-year period. Main work location is Odense/Denmark at SDU and Odense Havn (Odense Port). 
 Research environment 
 The candidate will be part of the ramp-up of SDU’s newly established center for Large Structure Production (LSP). LSP’s central ambition is to provide a physical “go-to” lab for companies in the sectors maritime, construction and energy to carry out research, development and testing of novel solutions in the production of large structures, such as buildings, ships and offshore platforms. In this context, the candidate is expected to work closely with our industrial partners on application-oriented use cases, while helping to commission and operate the unique set of equipment of the center. 
 LSP is integrated in the unit SDU Robotics that is at the core of the Odense Robotics Cluster involving 130+ startups and established companies in robotics. We are specialized in robot solutions involving modelling, simulation and control of advanced robot technologies (systems and services) for industrial, welfare and medical applications. 
 Our group is involved in a variety of national and European projects and features a strong network of academic and industrial partners. We solve challenging research problems derived from real-life challenges by implementing novel robot solutions. We value teamwork, professional diligence, enthusiasm for robotics and the drive to adopt new skills and extended responsibilities. We offer an open, international team, with flexible work organization and support of individual development. 
 Job description 
 The starting point for the candidate to develop their academic profile in LSP will be the development of Digital Twin-based solutions for analyzing, simulating and controlling robotic operations together with our partners Inrotech and Odense Maritime Technology. The aim is to yield a well-defined digital workflow from product design to production operations that is proven in real-life experiments. 
 The candidate will design and implement methods to i) analyze maritime structure designs based on digital models and discrete-event simulations of their production, and ii) implement means of automated control of robotic equipment based on detailed quasi-continuous 3D simulations of the required production operations, including multiple robots, tools and sensors. 
 Profile and requirements 
 The candidate is expected to have most of the following qualifications: 
 
 PhD degree in engineering with outstanding academic track record 
 Documented knowledge in industrial robotics and various types of simulation 
 Documented practical experience with industrial robot operations, e.g. welding 
 Strong programming skills (particularly in C/C++ and Python) 
 Strong mathematics skills and practical knowledge in 3D modelling 
 Ability to work independently as part of an agile team, with a strong sense of responsibility 
 Willingness to engage in application-oriented R&D, by closely interacting with company staff
