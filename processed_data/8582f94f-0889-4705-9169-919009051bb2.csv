Our group and research  The PhD Fellow will be employed in the Section for Diagnostic Imaging, Companion Animal Surgery and Clinical Specialities, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg Campus (Copenhagen).    The PhD fellow will become part of a group of highly dedicated and enthusiastic surgical researchers and clinicians with a strong network of leading national and international veterinary specialists. Our current research focus is clinically based with a strong focus on orthopaedic disease and aspects of surgical management and recovery postoperatively, but we wish to broaden our focus in the coming years to encompass more soft tissue surgery and minimally invasive approaches.    Project description  Oncologic surgery is key to management of many tumours in companion animals and humans. Visual inspection, palpation during surgery, and clinical knowledge are the primary factors for determining surgical margins and “dose” during oncologic surgery. Ensuring clean margins is thus associated with a degree of subjectivity which may risk underdosing and recurrence or overdosing and attendant morbidity.   The present PhD project will be focused on defining surgical dose in a minimally invasive setting, increasingly important in both veterinary and human surgery. The project is a collaboration with The Danish National Hospital. The phd student will be based at Section for Diagnostic Imaging, and Companion Animal Surgery and Clinical Specialities, Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences.
