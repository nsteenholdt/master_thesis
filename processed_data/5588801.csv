 The Centre for Technology Entrepreneurship (DTU Entrepreneurship) puts evidence-based research in focus on a wide range of management, pedagogic, and policy issues related to entrepreneurship and innovation. Our research promotes technology-based entrepreneurship by generating, disseminating, and applying knowledge and competencies to education and business development within and beyond DTU.  
 
 We collaborate closely with a range of industry partners, as well as private and public organizations. We strive to develop the entrepreneurial capabilities of students, civil society, executives, researchers, and policymakers to create positive social and economic change.

 The project focuses on the early stages of company formation and the shareholder agreements. The research will focus on new approaches to and methods to company formation as well as creating practically implementable tools and services for 'enlarging the pie' in shareholder agreements and equity splits. The research can draw upon research from various disciplines from social psychology, entrepreneurship, corporate governance, as well as legal contracts and IP agreements.
