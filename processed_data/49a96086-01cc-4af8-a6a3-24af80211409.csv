With this PhD position, we offer you the possibility of establishing your career as a scientist in photonic integrated circuits and underwater optical communication. You will be working at DTU Electro, in the Photonic Integrated Circuit based Systems (PICSys) group. The setting will be the cutting-edge laboratory for photonic integrated devices and advanced optical communications, and the access to one of the largest cleanroom facilities in European Universities. You will be working with a group of professionals in photonic integrated devices, optical phased array, optical communications, optical computing, and FPGA hardware programming.  
 
 We are seeking a highly motivated and talented candidate for a PhD position to join our team and contribute to our efforts in developing integrated optical phased array (OPA) for biomedical imaging. The successful candidate will work on an innovative project aimed at developing integrated optical phased array-based multi-photon lightsheet fluorescence microscopy, which has the promising potential to revolutionize current biological studies and diagnostic methodology. This position offers a unique opportunity to engage in photonic integrated circuits (PIC) research, collaborate with DTU Health Tech and Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at Copenhagen University, and drive the development of next-generation biomedical imaging solutions.  
 
 As a participant of the project, the PhD student will become part of a team at DTU with expertise in design, simulation, nanofabrication, characterization, and application of PIC. The activities within the project will benefit from synergies with other projects in the group as well as with other activities in the department. The main supervisor will be Dr. Hao Hu, DTU Electro. 
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 An OPA is a (periodic) arrangement of optical antennas that all emit light in phase to project a collimated beam. The emission angle and shape of this beam can be tuned by adjusting the relative phases and amplitudes that feed into the individual emitters or antennas. Particularly, OPAs are compatible with cheap and high-volume manufacturing. Due to the unique features of compact size, fast scanning and low cost, the integrated OPAs are becoming a transformative technology for solid-state beam steering.  
 
 Your overall focus will be developing integrated OPA on silicon nitride (SiN) platform for biomedical imaging. Your primary tasks will be: 
 Design and fabricate optical phased array chips on SiN platform 
 Characterize the integrated optical phased array with on-chip calibration functionality for solid-state optical beam steering and focus scanning 
 Applying integrated OPAs for biomedical imaging applications  
 Supervise BSc and MSc student project 
 Data analysis, writing of scientific articles and presentations at conferences and meetings. 
 Participate in outreach activities including, but not limited to, social media updates, participation in public events and campaigns, as well as dissemination to popular press. 
 
 The exact research activities will be continuously adapted to ensure high relevance and impact.  
 
 As part of the Danish Ph.D. program, you will follow a number of Ph.D. courses and you will have an opportunity to have external research stay at one of the partner universities in Europe. 
 
 You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. 
 
 Your required qualifications and skills are: 
 Excellent English communication skills both spoken and written.  
 Self-motivation in research and innovation. 
 Ability to work independently while effectively collaborating with partners.  
 A master level education in the fields of integrated photonics, silicon photonics, or nanophotonics. 
 Experience in simulation tools such as Lumerical, COMSOL. 
 
 As an ideal candidate, you should also have one or more competences below: 
 Experience in simulation, design, and characterization of photonic integrated circuits. 
 Prior experience in a cleanroom environment is a plus. 
 The ability to work independently while effectively collaborating in projects with both academic and industrial partners.  
 Experience with PCB and FPGA design. 
 
 Approval and Enrolment  
 
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see  DTU's rules for the PhD education

Working with industry and public organizations is one of our top priorities to find and implement new solutions to our society. We aim to offer education, research, and innovation of the highest standard, and our focus on application-oriented research enables us to work across many engineering disciplines and research areas, such as IT and the medical and health sciences. We have a close collaboration with researchers from all over the world, just as we collaborate with industry and public authorities about the dissemination of solutions based on electrical and photonics engineering as their key enabling technologies.

 DTU develops technology for people. With our international elite research and study programmes, we are helping to create a better world and to solve the global challenges formulated in the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Hans Christian Ørsted founded DTU in 1829 with a clear mission to develop and create value using science and engineering to benefit society. That mission lives on today. DTU has 13,500 students and 6,000 employees. We work in an international atmosphere and have an inclusive, evolving, and informal working environment. DTU has campuses in all parts of Denmark and in Greenland, and we collaborate with the best universities around the world.","https://www.google.dk/maps/place/Anker+Engelunds+Vej+101,2800,+Lyngby-Taarbæk/",30060946,False,False,,False
