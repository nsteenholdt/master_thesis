Aiming at a better characterisation of this variability, the candidate will work on the development and application of novel machine learning approaches that use brain data to achieve a better stratification of existing diagnoses and clinical information. In particular, we will design models that can bring together the different modalities existing in the UK Biobank, Cam-CAN and BioFIND datasets, leveraging concepts that lie in between the supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. This work will be in collaboration with Steve Smith and Mark Woolrich in Oxford University, and Rik Henson from Cambridge University. There will be opportunities to spend time in Oxford and Cambridge as part of the training. You will report to Associate Professor Diego Vidaurre Henche. Your competences  You have academic qualifications at PhD level, preferably within one or more of the following areas computational neuroscience, computer science, or a related discipline (e.g. physics/biophysics, mathematics, engineering).
