The BRIDGE – Translational Excellence Programme is financed by the Novo Nordisk Foundation with the ambition to train fellows in translational medicine, mentored by fully committed and top-level professionals in basic biomedical research, a clinical environment and the life science industry. The programme constitutes a clear career path for candidates whose ambition is to bridge the gap between research, patient care and the life science industry and for those wishing to become pioneering leaders in the field of translational medicine.   The BRIDGE – Translational Excellence Programme expects to appoint 7 fellows with an MD background and 7 fellows with an MSc background.   Application deadline is 16 February 2025, at 23:59 CET .  Appointed fellows are expected to participate in a two-day Boot Camp on 4-5 September 2025 .  Mentors are expected to participate on 4 September 2025.   Translational research project  Your research project must cover the early translational stages T₀ (Disease modelling, Omics studies, Basic Research) -T₁ (Biomarker discovery, Target development, Preclinical development) and should bridge a basic biomedical research environment and a clinical research environment, making the research project interdisciplinary in its nature. The project may also cover early T2 (First in human, phase 1 clinical trials, phase 2 clinical trials, phase 2b clinical trials), but this is not a requirement.    Your project must be at the postdoctoral level, should address a relevant medical challenge and should be ambitious yet feasible within the timeframe of two years. Your research project must be developed in collaboration with your Mentor Team and is an important part of the recruitment process to become a BRIDGE Fellow.   Appointed fellows spend 80% of their time on individual translational research projects mentored by a Mentor Team consisting of a basic biomedical scientist from a SUND Department or Centre, and a clinical scientist from a hospital in the Capital Region of Denmark or Region Zealand and/or from the life science industry. Additional mentors from other departments and universities in Denmark are encouraged if relevant.   Academic Curriculum  The BRIDGE – Translational Excellence Programme provides fellows with the ability to translate insights from basic research into the clinical sciences and/or the life science industry, and vice versa, and the competences to manage essential collaboration between disciplines.   A uniquely developed 57 days  Academic Curriculum  has been designed by top-professional experts and figures as a mandatory, integral, and important part of the BRIDGE programme.    The Academic Curriculum covers the translational stages  T0  (Population/clinic to lab feedback, disease modelling -omic studies, basic research),  T1  (Biomarker discovery, target development, pre-clinical development) and border to early  T2  (First in human, phase 1 clinical trials, phase 2 clinical trials, phase 2b clinical trials).    In addition, courses also include generic skills such as research management, ethics, research communication and successful grant writing. The Academic Curriculum and additional events such as the Boot Camp, Academic Afternoons, Alumni Event comprise 20% of fellows’ time. The fellows should therefore not be imposed teaching obligations during their fellowship.   Eligibility  Future BRIDGE Fellows must hold one of the following:       An MD and a PhD degree or equivalent (proof of an appointment that requires doctoral equivalency).  Specialist training is no hindrance to apply, and medical training is appreciated.   An MSc and a PhD degree within a relevant discipline such as veterinary science, biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, pharmacy, dentistry, or medical engineering.     The following requirements must also be met:   The PhD degree should have been obtained no more than eight years before the application deadline. Any  documented  periods of leave will be accepted as extensions of this time limit (maternity leave, paternity leave, family care leave, illness, military service, etc.).   As a current PhD student, you may apply if you and your supervisor expect your thesis to be submitted and defended prior to project commencement on 1 September 2025.  You must attach a declaration from your supervisor stating that your thesis will be submitted and defended prior to project commencement on 1 September 2025.   In Denmark, you can hold postdoc positions for no more than a total of four years at one university. Accordingly, no more than two years of postdoc experience based directly at UCPH prior to programme enrolment is allowed. Any  documented  periods of leave will be accepted as extensions of this time limit (parental leave, family care leave, illness, military service, etc.).  Please find more information about the 'four-year rule' for postdocs (Danish legislation) under  'Eligibility and conditions'  and about the applicable governmental jurisdiction  here .   Mentor Teams  The applicant must apply for the programme in cooperation with a Mentor Team consisting of a minimum two mentors.   A Mentor Team requires a mentor representing 1) the basic biomedical science from the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (SUND), UCPH, and 2) clinical science from the Capital Region of Denmark or Region Zealand  and/or  3) the life science industry environment in Denmark.  A life science industry mentor is highly encouraged to enter the Mentor Team.   We also encourage larger mentor teams with additional mentors from Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Faculty of Science (SCIENCE) at UCPH, or other universities or research institutions, if relevant.    Incorporating a mentor from SUND, UCPH, into the Mentor Team is mandatory. If a mentor acts as a  third, fourth or fifth  mentor – accompanying a basic and clinical mentor – that mentor may reside outside Denmark.   Qualifications  As a BRIDGE fellow, you are highly motivated to participate in the Academic Curriculum, to be mentored by senior researchers, network and cooperate with other BRIDGE Fellows and you see yourself as an ambitious scientist who will work on bridging the gaps between research, medical treatment and/or the life science industry.   We expect BRIDGE Fellows to be scientifically independent, showing a high degree of academic maturity. This means that they will have:     An enthusiastic interest in a translational research project co-designed with a Mentor Team and be a good match with a committed Mentor Team   A strong CV, having published in high-quality journals and presented at international conferences   The ability to manage one’s own academic research and associated activities   Experience with project management   Experience with supervision of more junior researchers (pre-graduate or PhD students)   Excellent interpersonal skills and leadership, including the ability to communicate research ideas and results in a clear and logical way and the ability to interact with peers and the broader research community confidently and effectively     How to apply  As a BRIDGE fellow, you will be working on a translational research project co-designed with a Mentor Team. As such, the first step in the application process is to connect with a Mentor Team.   If you   are not  already in contact with an eligible Mentor Team, we recommend that you:     Contact a (i) basic biomedical researcher from SUND, UCPH, a (ii) clinical scientist from a hospital in the Capital Region of Denmark or Region Zealand  and/or  (ii) a scientist from the life science industry who fits your research interests and fulfil the programme  requirements  for Mentor Teams.

Please find more information about the 'four-year rule' for postdocs (Danish legislation) under  'Eligibility and conditions'  and about the applicable governmental jurisdiction  here .   Mentor Teams  The applicant must apply for the programme in cooperation with a Mentor Team consisting of a minimum two mentors.   A Mentor Team requires a mentor representing 1) the basic biomedical science from the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (SUND), UCPH, and 2) clinical science from the Capital Region of Denmark or Region Zealand  and/or  3) the life science industry environment in Denmark.  A life science industry mentor is highly encouraged to enter the Mentor Team.   We also encourage larger mentor teams with additional mentors from Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Faculty of Science (SCIENCE) at UCPH, or other universities or research institutions, if relevant.    Incorporating a mentor from SUND, UCPH, into the Mentor Team is mandatory. If a mentor acts as a  third, fourth or fifth  mentor – accompanying a basic and clinical mentor – that mentor may reside outside Denmark.
