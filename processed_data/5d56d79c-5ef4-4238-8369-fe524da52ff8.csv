The project is part of the research project “ Universal growth laws of Viruses of Bacteria ”, which is financed by Novo Nordisk Foundation   Start date is (expected to be) 1 September 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  The project focuses on quantitative understanding of the viruses infecting bacteria (bacteriophages). Our goal is to achieve a universal understanding of interaction between viruses and their hosts.  Phages are key drivers of microbial ecology, gene transfer and microbial evolution. They serve an ideal  in-vivo  model system to study virus-host interactions. We aim to explore virus development upon infection as a dynamic and stochastic process exhibiting decision-making behaviours. We also study the role of phages at various scales, from population to ecological levels to investigate epidemics as it spread in 2 or 3-dimensional geometries. Our research integrates theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches. We develop mathematical and computational models to mimic, suggest and perform experiments on these fascinating systems. The position offers the flexibility to explore a wide range of topics driven by the candidate’s interest in bacteria-phage systems.    Who are we looking for?  We are looking for a talented, highly motivated, and creative scientist who is interested in exploring fundamental questions in the exciting field of physics of life. Scientists with strong mathematical and computational skills in physics and complex systems who want to extend their skills to biological systems, especially on microbial systems, are strongly encouraged to apply. The position offers close collaboration with experimental biologists. Successful candidates must be imaginative and possess the curiosity to drive the project forward. Candidates must have excellent English skills, both written and oral. We are looking for candidates within the field(s) of Physics, Biophysics, Quantitative Biology, Systems Biology, Complex Systems, or related disciplines.    Our group and research- and what do we offer?  We are part of the Center for Models of Life in the Biocomplexity section at the Niels Bohr Institute, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, located in Copenhagen. Our research focuses on the science of complex phenomena in physics and biology. We engage on topics ranging from networks, non-equilibrium systems, gene regulatory dynamics, virus-host interactions, pattern formation, epidemics, microbial ecology and evolution, development of stem cells. We formulate models based on physical and mathematical principles and study these models with analytical and numerical methods. Additionally, we perform experiments on bacteria-phage systems in our local laboratory. We have close national and international collaboration with many labs, for instance in Switzerland, USA, Japan, and India. The successful candidate is expected to visit these labs. Our environment is dynamic and fosters fantastic scientific and social interactions with many talented researchers.
