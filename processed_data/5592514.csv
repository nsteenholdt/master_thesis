 DTU Compute's Section for Cognitive Systems invites applications for a 3-year PhD position.  
 
 Description 
 
 To date, most successful applications of deep learning in signals and decoding are based on supervised learning. However, supervised learning is contingent on the availability of labeled data, i.e., each sample has a semantic annotation. The need for labeled data is a serious limitation to bio-medical applications at scale and complicates the maintenance of real-life neuroimaging systems. Here we will combine international open source data with local, high quality labeled data.  
 
 The typical situation is that unlabeled data is abundant, and this has given rise to paradigms such as semi-supervised and self-supervised learning (SSL). Both directions in SSL are based on combining large amounts of unlabeled data with limited labeled data. While semi-supervised learning invokes generative models to learn representations that support learning with few labels, SSL is based on supervised learning with a supervisory signal derived from the data itself.  
 
 This scholarship is funded by the Pioneer Centre for AI's collaboratory, Signals and Decoding. The Pioneer Centre for AI is located at the University of Copenhagen, with partners at Aarhus University, Aalborg University, The Technical University of Denmark, and the IT University of Copenhagen. There will be a cohort of PhD students starting during the fall of 2022 across the partner universities. PhD students at the Pioneer Centre for AI will have extraordinary access computing resources, to international researchers across many disciplines within computer sciences and other academic areas, as well as courses and events at the centre, and meaningful collaboration with industry, the public sector, and the start-up ecosystem. Centre website: Aicentre.dk. http://Aicentre.dk  
 
 Responsibilities 
 
 During this PhD program, you are expected to:  Expand on the emerging theoretical and experimental understanding of SSL  
 Focus on a application of SSL in EEG based brain state decoding  
 Publish scientific papers and present research results in top AI conferences (NeurISP. ICLR, ICML) and neuroimaging journals (Neural Computation, Neuroimage etc)  
 Do research during the PhD program at other units of the Pioneer Centre and abroad.  
 Work as a teaching assistant in two or three 5 ECTS courses at DTU  
 
 
 Qualifications 
 
 Candidates should have the following required skills:  A master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar in Computer Science, Informatics, Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics or equivalent  
 Proven experience in Python  
 Hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks  
 High level of motivation and innovation  
 Excellent written and communication skills in English  
 
 
 Approval and Enrolment 
 
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules  
 
 Assessment
