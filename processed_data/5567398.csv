Job content   Digitalization is changing how organizations approach and manage their internal communications as well as their relationships with the outside world: the technological development of organizations is increasingly focused on data-driven processes, which has significant consequences for the way they work and are perceived, for example, through algorithmic decision-making. This condition challenges established practices and, ultimately, the normative frameworks governing any organization. Understanding the process and impact of digitalization on both public and private organizations requires substantial knowledge and a nuanced analysis of digital systems as such, as well as of the organizational contexts in which they operate.    The ideal candidate for the advertised position holds a PhD in communication research, information studies, or a comparable field, and has a strong track record of employing quantitative analysis and/or data science methods in the analysis of organizational digitalization, as well as in organizational communication theories, organizational studies, or human-computer interaction. The successful applicant will have a strong record of international publications and will have a research agenda of interdisciplinary work on the digital transformation of organizations.   The Department of Communication is home to approx. 80 faculty members, 40 PhD students, 20 postdocs, 40 part-time lecturers, 27 administrative staff, and 2200 students.

The department offers seven degree programs: Philosophy, Rhetoric, Education, Film and Media Studies, Communication and IT, Information Studies, and Cognition & Communication educating successful candidates to many sectors and parts of the Danish society and beyond.   Read more about the Department of Communication at:  https://comm.ku.dk .   Copenhagen is a highly diverse and international Scandinavian capital with a green profile. Education is free and child-care is subsidized. Public transport is well-developed and most Copenhageners take their bikes to work. There are lots of green areas in and around Copenhagen, the water in the harbour is clean enough for swimming, and the city has multiple museums and other cultural venues.

The successful candidate post will be obliged to complete a teacher-training course designed especially for assistant professors and will be expected to be able to take part in all the activities of the Department, including examinations and administration.   Approximately six months before the end of the six-year period as assistant professor, a committee set up by the Dean will assess whether the assistant professor can be considered for promotion to a tenured position as associate professor.    Read more about the tenure-track programme at the UCPH here:  http://employment.ku.dk/tenure-track/tenure-track-at-ucph/ .
