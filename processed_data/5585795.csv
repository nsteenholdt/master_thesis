 Job description 
 Research in the Department is organized in three research groups, and the announced position will be part of the Research Group "" Markets, Organization, and Behavior"". The research focus of the RG “Markets, Organization, and Behavior” (see the complete profile of the group here:  link ) is on consumer and business behavior based on theories from social sciences (incl. microeconomics). The research approach of this research group is based on theoretically founded empirical analyses of the economic behavior of individuals, groups (e.g., households), organizations, or business enterprises. The research group has a particular interest in some specific markets and industries and their specific characteristics. These include, inter alia, sports, media, event, tourism, energy, and retailing markets (e.g., FMCGs and services). The group further participates actively in the research involved in the University’s Sustainable Markets Cluster and Center for Rural Research.

We seek applicants with a strong research potential and the ability to work in a collaborative environment with a focus on industrial organization and consumer behavior. The preferred applicants’ research activity is expected to complement the group’s research profile and to be published in the most relevant high-quality international journals. The successful applicant should demonstrate empirical research interests in the analysis of industrial organization and has – preferably – conducted research with respect to one or more of the aforementioned industries/markets. Experiences in applying state-of-the-art research methods (e.g., experiments) and quantitative analysis tools (e.g., panel data analysis) will be beneficial. Potential focus areas of the applicant’s research activities could be (non-ordered, non-exclusive list): 
 
 Industrial organization 
 Behavioral economics 
 Micro-economics and micro-econometrics 
 Economics of sports, events, media 
 
 The successful applicant is expected to play an active role in the Research Group “Markets, Organization, and Behavior” and to be able to work collaboratively with colleagues in this and other research groups at the Department.
