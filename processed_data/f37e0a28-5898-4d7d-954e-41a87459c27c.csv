Title Privacy-preserved Efficient Contrastive Multi-View Clustering Research area and project description This project focuses on an important research direction of multimodal learning, Multi-view Clustering (MVC), which aims to find patterns and clusters across these multi-view data to achieve a better understanding of the entity, such as classifying cancers using multi-omics data from different hospitals. Most solutions focus on centralized setups or ignore the privacy concerns of distributed setups. This project aims to enhance the privacy protection in distributed MVC without performance deterioration via incorporating techniques such as contrastive learning, to improve the intra-view consensus while introducing new distance metrics to maximize intercluster separability. During the project, the student has opportunities and resources (such as lab and devices) to apply the developed MVC techniques to analyze multimodal biosignals collected from Virtual Reality sessions. This can significantly increase the potential impact of the developed techniques by enabling it to many interesting applications.   Project description (½-4 pages).

The project has a heavy focus on trustworthy AI, thus the background in AI especially distributed AI and/or privacy-preserved AI is preferred. The applicants should be willing to work with a wide range of experimental and theoretical topics. Experience or interest in exploring using AI in VR is a bonus.
