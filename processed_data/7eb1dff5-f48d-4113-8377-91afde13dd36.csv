 The position is available - initially for six months - from June 1, 2025, or as soon as possible thereafter - with the possibility of extension for three years. 
 Tiwari lab employs cutting-edge genomics and molecular biology technologies with bioinformatics and machine learning to decipher principles of gene regulation. In this project, the candidate will develop new computational strategies to identify human genetic variation linked to human diseases in particular psychiatric disorders and cancer. The candidate can use and combine single-cell ATAC-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, spatial gene expression, and whole-genome sequencing (with long reads) data. The candidate will get the opportunity to explore new analysis methods using deep learning. Depending on the interest, it is also possible to be involved in the wet lab, to perform single-cell sequencing and other experiments.
