The successful candidate will investigate how cancer cell-educated neutrophils support metastatic spread and whether drugs modifying neutrophil development could prove effective in inhibiting metastatic disease. The project is funded by the independent research found Denmark. The position is available from May 1 st , 2025, or as soon as possible thereafter. 
 This position offers an exciting opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research in cancer biology. You will lead a research project that focuses on understanding how tumors influence the local and systemic development of prometastatic neutrophils and their specific impact on the metastatic process. You will employ advanced techniques such as spectral flowcytometry and cell sorting, intra vital imaging, spatial transcriptomics and RNA sequencing. The ideal candidate will have a background in molecular biology, cancer research or immunology. Experience with animal cancer models, flowcytometry and RNA sequencing are preferred, while basic understanding in bioinformatic analysis will be an advantage.         
 The Postdoc position is available in the group of Associate Professor Mikkel Green Terp ( Terp group ), focusing on how interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment regulate therapy responses and metastasis. 
 Research environment

The close ties between the basic and translational research at SDU and the clinical research at OUH provides a unique opportunity to translate your findings into a clinical setting through local collaborations. In addition, we have extensive international networks in the cancer field providing a great setting for establishing international collaborations.  
 We value teamwork, professional diligence, enthusiasm for cancer research and the drive to adopt new skills and techniques.  
 What we need
