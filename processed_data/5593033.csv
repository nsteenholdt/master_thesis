Description of Scientific Environment  The PhD students will be working in the Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) group headed by Jakob Nordström (http://www.jakobnordstrom.se), which is active at both the University of Copenhagen and Lund University on either side of the Øresund Bridge.   The MIAO research group has a unique profile in that we are doing cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms for real-world problems. This creates a very special environment, where we do not only conduct in-depth research on different theoretical and applied topics, but where different lines of research cross-fertilise each other and unexpected and exciting synergies often arise. Much of the activities of the group revolve around powerful algorithmic paradigms such as, e.g., Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, Gröbner basis computations, integer linear programming, and constraint programming. This leads to classical questions in computational complexity theory—though often with new, fascinating twists—but also involves work on designing and coding up clever algorithms that can exploit the power of such paradigms in practice.   We are fortunate to be part of the Algorithms and Complexity Section at DIKU, which is world-leading in algorithms and complexity theory (currently ranked 6th worldwide by CSrankings.org). DIKU hosts the Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre (https://barc.ku.dk/) joint with the IT University of Copenhagen, and we also have extensive collaborations with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and with Lund University on the Swedish side of the Øresund Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational research, we do have a track record of surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major industrial applications.   The University of Copenhagen was founded in 1479 and is the oldest and largest university in Denmark. It is often ranked as the best university in Scandinavia and consistently as one of the top places in Europe. Within computer science, it is ranked 2nd in the European Union (post-Brexit) by ShanghaiRanking.   Further information about the Department of Computer Science and the Faculty of Science can be found at http://www.science.ku.dk/english/about-the-faculty/organisation/. Inquiries about the positions can be made to Jakob Nordström at jn@di.ku.dk. Candidates interested in working with other faculty in the Algorithms and Complexity Section (https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/vip/researchers_ac/) are also encouraged to apply and state this clearly in their application.   Job description   The positions are available for period of 3-5 years, depending on your current education level as discussed further below, and your key tasks as a PhD student at SCIENCE are to:     Manage and carry through your research project.
