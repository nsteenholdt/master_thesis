 If so, you should consider applying for a 3-year position as PhD-student at the DTU Wind & Energy Systems, Division Wind Energy Materials and Components, starting in October 2022. The Ph.D. project will be supervised by Professor Bent F. Sørensen and Associate Professor Xiao Chen.  
 
 Job description 
 
 ""Elements test"" specimens are purposely-designed structures with the aim of checking the accuracy of model predictions of damage evolution in composite structures subjected to static and cyclic loading. For wind turbines blades, there is a need for such element test specimens for the study of damage at structural details. The project involves both design and simulation of damage growth in 2-4 different types of element specimens, and subsequently manufacturing and testing of the element specimens. The design and simulation of damage evolution of the element specimens will be made by the use of finite element modelling and cohesive zone modelling. Input to the simulations will be fracture mechanics properties of interfaces (e.g. mixed mode cohesive laws and fatigue crack growth rates) that are determined independently from mixed mode fracture experiments. The predicted damage growth from the models will be compared with the damage evolution in the real element specimens. The characterization of the damage evolution can be supported by sensors (e.g. acoustic emission), thermal and high-speed cameras and fractography in port-mortem analysis.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 During this PhD program, you are expected to:  Conduct mixed mode fracture mechanics experiments, e.g. using double cantilever beam specimens loaded by uneven bending moments in collaboration with our research technicans  
 Data analysis, e.g., extraction of mixed mode cohesive laws from exterimental data  
 Develop finite element models of element specimens and sumulate progressive failure by cohesive zone modelling  
 Plan and conduct experimental work together with development engineers and research technicians: manufacturing and mechanical testing of element specimens  
 Disseminate the results in peer-reviewed top profile journals  
 
 
 As a formal qualification, you must have a two-year master's degree in mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. Furthermore, strong English communication skills are essential. Applicants should be highly motivated, ambitious, and eager to seek and share knowledge, willing and able to work independently and in a team.  
 
 Preference will be given to applicant that can document experience in the following fields:  Solid mechanics  
 Mechanics of composite materials  
 Experimental mechanics (materials testing)  
 Finite element modelling (e.g. by Abaqus)  
 Cohesive zone modelling  
 Programming involving FORTRAN, C++, Python or MATLAB  
 
 
 Approval and Enrolment 
 
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules
