 DTU Wind and Energy Systems seeks candidates for several PhD positions within the general topic of Digital Methods for Life Cycle Analysis, O&M (Operations and Maintenance) and Prognostics. We invite applications with a talent and passion for numerical simulations, software tool development, data analytics and statistics for a position as PhD student at DTU Wind Energy.  
 
 DTU Wind and Energy Systems is a world-leading wind energy department that puts knowledge to work through cutting-edge research, innovation and development of technology. We have internationally leading research environments, and we prioritize strong cross-disciplinary collaborations within DTU, with leading international universities and facilities, and with private companies. We have a strong focus on the development of wind energy as the backbone of the future energy system and collaborate with the full sector, from sub-suppliers of materials and components, the wind turbine industry to the developers, planners and authorities.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 We seek PhD students who can contribute to the advancement of our wind turbine and component digital twin frameworks through developing the research-based technology enablers in several potential work areas. Depending on the candidates' qualifications, we target one or more of the following individual PhD project topics:  Decision tools for autonomous wind turbine operation. This project focuses on improving models for fault detection based on operational data such as SCADA or inspections, fault identification and prognostics, developing indicators for turbine health status, decision modeling, uncertainty quantification and risk analysis.  
 Uncertainty quantification of the wind turbine modeling chain. All digital models and the data that feeds them come with uncertainty that can affect decisions and lead to non-optimal design and operation. The scope of this project is to carry out a systematic uncertainty quantification on the various elements of the wind turbine design and prognostics model chains. The project activities include parametric studies, data processing, surrogate model training, uncertainty analysis, meta-studies. Potentially field validation if data is available.  
 Development of conceptual physics based wind turbine drive train models capable of coupling the operation state with the electromagnetic  
 mechanical - thermal response in order to evaluate the lifetime of specific components. Secondly estimating the sustainability impact of the material used in the drive trains (steel, copper, permanent magnets and superconductors) should be targeted.  
 Life cycle analysis of next generation offshore and floating wind farms. This project aims to develop high fidelity probabilistic cost models, focusing in all stages of the project development and with particular focus in optimizing operation and maintenance expenditure. The project will consider reliability distributions across a wind farm as well as quantify reliability of novel components through concepts of quantitative reliability assessment.  
 Data-driven asset management for large scale wind farms. This project aims to perform a mapping of data relevant to the design and operation of offshore wind farms, with a view to optimize through life operation through maximizing value of data. The developed methods should consider future trends including floating wind farms and autonomous systems.  
 
 
 You will be part of the SIL team with experts in the field of structural dynamics, wind turbine drive train design, applied statistics and Machine Learning. We work on problems spanning from component to wind farm level. The Structural Integrity and Loads Assessment Section within DTU, is currently running a number of EU projects which may provide input to this projects, including Flagship, Hiperwind and Realcoe, with participation of a number of key players active in the wind energy market. The particular areas of your responsibilities include:  Plan and manage your PhD project in collaboration with supervisors  
 Develop as well as use existing simulation frameworks to run scenarios of wind turbine operation and dynamic response  
 Use statistical analysis to validate your models and obtain useful insights  
 Carry out code development and documentation within collaborative environments such as Gitlab  
 Collaborate with industrial partners and share your knowledge  
 Disseminate your findings on conferences and in the relevant journals  
 Contribute to education as teaching assistant and co-supervisor of BSc and MSc student projects.  
 
 
 Depending on the specific project scope, the following additional responsibilities may come into play:  Develop fault detection or other data analytics models using Data Science and Machine Learning tools  
 Carry out uncertainty quantification and propagation using statistical and Machine Learning methods.
