We are looking for a PhD candidate with a background in sociolinguistics or related fields and preferably with experience in linguistic ethnography who is motivated to undertake doctoral research as part of a five-year collaborative project on text-generative AI and the university (AI-UNI) funded by the Carlsberg Foundation.    AI-UNI  Large language models and their application as part of text-generative AI are rapidly changing the way we engage with language. The ways we write, read, speak and listen are all being transformed by various forms of AI technology which are quickly becoming part of the mainstream. In the university context these changes will have – and have in fact already had – quite fundamental consequences for how knowledge is produced, acquired, and disseminated. AI-UNI contributes to an empirically founded and theoretically coherent understanding of how text-generative language technologies affect research, teaching and learning practices in academia, and what the implications are for knowledge production, dissemination and evaluation.    The AI-UNI project is designed to 1) document ongoing change in the way generative language technology is used as part of academic practices, 2) critically assess the associated implications for research, teaching, and learning, and 3) progressively build a theoretical model of human engagement with generative language technology as a site of sociolinguistic change. The research team achieves these ends by conducting linguistic ethnographic case studies of how research staff and students across different faculties at Danish universities use text-generative language technologies as part of their everyday practices and by using survey methods to document change over time in the general uptake of AI at Danish universities as part of research, teaching and learning.   The project is led by Professor Janus Mortensen (PI) and Assistant Professor Sanne Larsen. See the full project team on the AI-UNI website  www.ai-uni.dk .   The PhD project  The successful PhD candidate will undertake an independent PhD research project, designed to fit the overall research agenda of AI-UNI.    The PhD student will be expected to design and conduct a linguistic ethnographic case study focussing on the use of text-generative AI as part of  research practices  in the humanities or social sciences. The case study will revolve around one or two research groups (or similar university research unit). Following an initial period of observation, specific practices that involve the use of generative AI should be selected for detailed study in the remaining time of the field work.   Applicants are expected to outline a proposed research design for their case study as part of the application (see details below). The proposed PhD project should allow the PhD candidate to explore how text-generative AI is used as part of academic practices and critically assess the associated implications for research. The project should fall within the general framework of linguistic ethnography. This means that we welcome projects that include e.g. participant observation, recordings of textual practices and social interaction in offline and online environments, as well as ethnographic interviews and feedback sessions with participants. Theoretically, the PhD project should contribute to the host project’s understanding of the use of text-generative AI at the university as a site of sociolinguistic change with potential implications for how we conceptualize the notions of literacy and voice in sociolinguistics. The PhD thesis can take the form of a monograph, or it can be a compilation of articles, depending on the nature of the proposed project and the preferences of the successful candidate.   The specific focus and details of the project will be decided in collaboration with the host project PI, based on the ideas presented in the PhD project description and the overall research interests of the AI-UNI project. The PhD student will be supervised by professor Janus Mortensen and co-supervised by assistant professor Sanne Larsen.   Qualification requirements     Applicants must have a relevant 2-year Master’s degree (120 ECTS or equivalent), possibly with a specialization ( speciale ) within the areas of sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, applied linguistics or similar. The qualifications of applicants with non-Danish Master’s degrees will be assessed to ascertain whether they correspond to the Danish level. For further information, please refer to the website of the Danish Ministry of Education and Research:  https://ufm.dk/en/education/recognition-and-transparency/find-assessments/general-assessments-for-specific-countries/?set_language=en .   The successful applicant must have advanced analytical skills and be a strong communicator in English. We expect the PhD thesis to be written in English. If deemed necessary, CIP may request that applicants document their English skills.   Due to the collaborative nature of the host project, it is essential that the candidate has excellent collaborative skills and a strong interest in being part of a close-knit research team.   Since the case study may involve data in Danish as well as English, knowledge of Danish or another Scandinavian language is preferable, but not mandatory.   Specialist knowledge of AI is  not  a requirement.     More information on types of academic positions at UCPH and requirements for the different positions is available here:  https://employment.ku.dk/faculty/career-at-upch/ .   Assessment criteria     The quality, originality and feasibility of the proposed PhD project.   Relevance of the PhD project for the host project.

These documents must be translated into English, Danish, Norwegian or Swedish. An official description of the grading scale (and a diploma supplement where relevant) must also be attached.   5.

The PhD student will be supervised by professor Janus Mortensen and co-supervised by assistant professor Sanne Larsen.   Qualification requirements     Applicants must have a relevant 2-year Master’s degree (120 ECTS or equivalent), possibly with a specialization ( speciale ) within the areas of sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, applied linguistics or similar.
