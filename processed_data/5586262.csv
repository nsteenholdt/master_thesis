This project is financed by the start-up grant of Associate Professor Cosmin E. Oancea.   The start date is (expected to be) 1st of October 2022, or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  The project will build on the existent infrastructure of the Futhark language and optimizing compiler, which is developed locally at DIKU and is thought as a research vehicle for studying aggressive analysis (static, dynamic, and hybrid), aimed primarily at optimizing highly-parallel applications. The underlying philosophy is rooted in language-compiler co-design, namely that the language exposes higher-order constructs, whose richer semantics simplifies compiler analysis, and vice-versa, advanced analysis allows stronger properties to be enforced at language level and exploited by later compiler analyses. For example, Futhark recently supports both forward and reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) by second-order language primitives, which are implemented as a non-trivial code transformation, whose derivation, at its turn, takes full advantage of the higher-order semantics of the parallel operators.    The overall goal of the project is to extend Futhark with whatever is necessary in order to support efficient execution in a distributed memory setting, such as clusters of GPUs. Such extensions may be designed at all levels. Examples may include (but are not limited to):     language level: in the form of constructs whose semantics may be helpful in optimizing communication later on;   compiler’s front-end: type-checking analysis for supporting more advanced forms of size typing;   mid-level analysis: aimed for example at aggregating memory references and at restructuring the code such as to optimize communication overheads;   compiler’s back-end: specialized code generation for IR constructs, with emphasis on utilizing, whenever beneficial, low-level vendor-specific solutions, such as Cuda’s unified-memory model.       Impact will be demonstrated on AI workloads, including deep learning and ML algorithms such as  convolutional and recurrent neural networks, support-vector machines, decision trees, time-series decomposition, nearest neighbor searches based on k-d trees.   We envision that the project will start by examining a comprehensive set of existent Futhark implementations of such algorithms, which will allow to hypothesize a set of language extensions and/or analyses that can be combined to result in efficient execution in a distributed environment for all of them.   Who are we looking for?  We are looking for candidates within the field(s) of computer science, computer engineering and the like, but we will consider candidates from other fields of study if they demonstrate competences that are in the scope of the project. Demonstrated expertise in subfields such as programming language design and implementation, optimizing compilers, high-performance computing and high-performance implementation of AI algorithms will be considered a plus.   Our group and research- and what do we offer?  The PhD student will join the Programming Languages and Theory of Computing Section at Department of Computer Science (DIKU), which currently consists of more than 27 researchers, among which 12 assistant, associate and full professors, who study a broad range of topics related to the principles and practice of programming language design and implementation.   The PhD student will closely collaborate with the team developing Futhark (https://futhark-lang.org/), a state-of-the-art functional language and optimizing compiler aimed at highly-parallel architectures, which has been internationally recognized in publications at top conferences such as PLDI, PPoPP, SC, ICDE, ICFP, TACO, and which has been a generator of research for several PhD theses and more than forty MSc and BSc theses.     The group is a part of the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. We are located in Copenhagen.   We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in dynamic and international research environment. Our research facilities include access to a smallish but dedicated cluster equipped with top-end GPUs, such as Nvidia’s A100 and AMD’s MI100.
