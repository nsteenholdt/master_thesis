You can read more about the department  here  and about the faculty  here . About the research project The positions are associated with a larger Horizon Europe-funded research program entitled “The human genetic and immunological determinants of the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection – towards personalized medicine” (UNDINE). The aims of the projects are to decipher the human genetic and immunological basis of the various SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations, to gain knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and to identify individuals at increased risk of critical COVID-19, post-infectious immunological complications, and vaccine failure. The goal is to provide the knowledge base for development of diagnostic tests and propose novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. To achieve these goals, the consortium will coordinate a European multidisciplinary and translational research project, closely associated with the global consortium COVID Human Genetic Effort (covidhge.com), relying on a strong and synergistic combination of assets, including unique patient cohorts from 11 EU countries, state-of-the art human genetic, immunological, and virological expertises and technologies. You will work on projects investigating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, whole exome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of patient samples for the identification and characterization of novel primary immunodeficiencies associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 and other SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations. The research group comprises at present 1 assistant professor, 3 postdocs, 3 PhD students, 1 medical research year student, and 1 laboratory technician.
