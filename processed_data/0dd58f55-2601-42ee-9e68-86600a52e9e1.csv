 The affiliation with the  Danish Institute for Advanced Study  (DIAS) as DIAS chair facilitates the establishment of an internationally competitive research area in line with the currently active research of the department within Physics. The research area should expand and complement existing activities in physics, meaning that synergy with existing research along with a clearly recognizable novel research line and focus is considered ideal. However, other research directions will also be relevant and both experimental and theoretical applicants will be considered.  
 We are looking for a Full professor with an associated chair in DIAS within Physics with a starting date in 2025.  
 About  DIAS DIAS at SDU is a hub for scientific excellence at and beyond the frontier of knowledge, bringing together outstanding researchers from various disciplines to foster cross-fertilization between fields and stimulate interdisciplinary projects. It hosts Chairs and Fellows from all faculties of the university, fostering an interdisciplinary environment. DIAS encourages and supports curiosity-driven research and fosters the meeting of minds across disciplines and levels of seniority. The center cultivates an ambitious, open-minded and playful environment that nurtures both academic growth and a strong sense of community.   The candidate will be anticipated to contribute actively to DIAS, including but not limited to participation in DIAS activities, mentoring of DIAS fellows, and promotion of DIAS nationally, internationally and within SDU, as well as through strengthening the bonds between the department/faculty on one hand and DIAS on the other, through interdisciplinary collaborations, where meaningful.  
 About the Faculty of Science The  Faculty of Science  is a leading hub for research and innovation, proudly home to a wide range of prestigious ERC projects. 
 The faculty is centered around 4 strong Departments with well-functioning research environments and excellent researchers, who through groundbreaking projects, contribute to new knowledge and solutions to global challenges. 
 With a strong focus on scientific excellence, the faculty creates an inspiring environment for both established and emerging researchers passionate about making a difference in the field of science.  
 About the Department of Physics, Chemistry and Pharmacy The Department of Physics, Chemistry and Pharmacy offers a broad range of collaboration opportunities within research, funding applications and teaching, which are all essential tasks in the offered fellowship. The successful candidate will be part of the  Section for Physics  and will work in a highly collaborative atmosphere with theorists and experimental scientists. 
 Read more about the Department:  Department of Physics, Chemistry and Pharmacy main website 
 Existing research areas The department has several strong research groups in the following two main areas of physics that also span collaborations with other departments: (1) biophysics and soft condensed matter (PhyLife) and (2) particle and astroparticle physics, classical and quantum gravity, and cosmology (CP3-Origins). 
 
 The scientists in PhyLife  study the physical principles of biological phenomena and the behavior of biological materials and cover a wide range of topics using experimental, theoretical and computational approaches. Active research areas include self-assembled complex systems such as biomembranes, polymers, liquid crystals, as well as membrane proteins, bioimaging, image analysis, and statistical physics.   
 The international research environment at CP3-Origins includes researchers who focus on the formal development of fundamental quantum theories of nature and their phenomenology, key questions of cosmology, particle physics, astrophysics and quantum and classical aspects of gravity. These include the origin of the Universe, inflation, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, black holes, gravitational waves, and involvement in the Event Horizon Telescope. Our researchers are also members of various international experimental collaborations investigate astrophysical phenomena and search for so-far undetected fundamental constituents of matter.  
 
 Requirements and qualifications Research: The ideal candidate holds a PhD degree in physics and has established a visionary, independent and internationally visible research profile as documented by an excellent track record of publications/research. Applicants may currently be employed at associate professor level and are   expected to be evaluated at Full Professor level at the time of the appointment or shortly hereafter through the  promotion program at the Faculty of Science .  
 The successful applicant will be able to attract substantial external funding based on a strong CV and research profile. Collaborative possibilities with physicists (and other researchers) in the department and experience with collaboration will be an advantage.  
 Teaching: The ideal candidate has a strong teaching record and is an enthusiastic and highly motivated teacher, showing creativity in teaching. You will also be expected to demonstrate experience with teaching courses within the physics curriculum at bachelor and master level as well as experience with project supervision on all levels from bachelor to PhD.  
 Other requirements and tasks:  
 
 Interest in interdisciplinary research and bridge-building towards relevant scientific disciplines of interdisciplinary nature within the Department or more broadly at SDU and DIAS. 
 Initiate and participate in public, media and local school outreach activities, ability to communicate clearly 
 Active presence in DIAS and promote DIAS actively at SDU, nationally and internationally.  
 Participate in the daily operation, administration and further development of the department’s strategy and education programs.   
 
 Regarding research funding support The Danish funding landscape is rich and diverse with several public and private foundations. As a researcher, this gives you ample opportunities for financing your research, whether you are looking for grants for minor research projects, large personal research efforts, or large collaborative endeavors. Of note, several foundations offer calls targeted researchers moving to Denmark, providing financial support for establishing the research lab. The calls targets researchers at all levels of seniority and with a very broad research scope. You can find an overview of recruitment calls  here . 
 The faculty has a research support team specialized in offering tailored support to researchers irrespective of scientific focus and career stage .
