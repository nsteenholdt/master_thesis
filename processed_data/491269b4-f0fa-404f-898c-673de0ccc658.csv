The position is available from 01 September 2025 or later. You can submit your application via the link under 'how to apply'. Title PhD Position in Wetland Restoration and Nature-Based Solutions for Biodiversity and Climate Resilience Research area and project description This PhD position is part of a research project exploring the transformative role of wetlands as nature-based solutions (NBS) in addressing water scarcity, enhancing biodiversity, and bolstering climate resilience. Wetlands provide multifunctional benefits, including drought mitigation, carbon sequestration, habitat restoration, and enhanced ecosystem services. However, effective management and stewardship are essential for sustaining these contributions, requiring a deeper understanding of how interventions bring about ecological changes and shape future wetland dynamics. The PhD candidate will investigate the ecological impacts of wetland restoration and management across seven showcase areas in Europe, with a particular focus on a subset of wetlands in Denmark. By combining historical and newly collected biological data, the research will evaluate biodiversity recovery, carbon sequestration, extinction risk reduction, and species colonization patterns under varied management scenarios. Fieldwork will play a central role, with biodiversity surveys focusing on plant and invertebrate species depending on relevance and candidate knowledge and interest (e.g., freshwater invertebrates, hoverflies, dragonflies, birds, plants, mosses, etc.). The research can include:   Monitoring biodiversity indicators, including species diversity and abundance, to evaluate habitat quality and ecosystem benefits provided by wetlands. Predicting biodiversity recovery under different wetland management strategies and validating these predictions through fieldwork. Adapting existing monitoring protocols and employing advanced techniques like DNA barcoding to assess species diversity and abundance. Comparing biodiversity outcomes across different successional stages of NBS. Collaborating with local stakeholders to engage citizen scientists in monitoring efforts, ensuring the continuous recovery and long-term sustainability of NBS initiatives. This position offers the opportunity to contribute to a fast-growing field of research, combining practical fieldwork with advanced ecological analysis to create scalable, evidence-based solutions for wetland restoration and management. Project description (½-4 pages) . Please upload a project description. This document should describe your ideas, approach, and overall research plans for this specific project. If you wish to, you can indicate an URL where further information can be found. Qualifications and specific competences Applicants should hold a Master’s degree (or equivalent qualification) in ecology, biology, entomology, environmental science, climate science, computational biology, geography, or a related field. We are looking for an avid and motivated candidate with a strong academic background and a genuine commitment to advancing knowledge in biodiversity conservation and wetland ecology. The ideal candidate should have knowledge of and interest in biodiversity and ecology, along with relevant experience in ecological and geographic data analysis. Skills in handling data using R or other coding environments is beneficial. The ability to solve complex research problems, including designing experiments and interpreting results within the context of global environmental change and ecosystem dynamics, is essential. Applicants are expected to show proficiency in both oral and written English and the ability to write scientific publications. Experience communicating scientific ideas to both specialized and broader audiences will be highly valued. The ability to assume responsibility for tasks and seek guidance as appropriate, while contributing constructively within interdisciplinary and international research teams is important. We are looking for someone who is motivated to work in a collaborative academic environment and can bring effort and insight to their work. Relevant experience in biodiversity monitoring, land-use systems, or climate impact studies would be an asset, particularly if the candidate has contributed to peer-reviewed publications or technical reports. Experience integrating ecological concepts into research and working well in interdisciplinary teams will also be valuable.
