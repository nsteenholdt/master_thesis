At DTU Management, you will conduct cutting-edge research in modeling and analyzing integrated urban transport systems that provide door-to-door mobility for passengers and goods.  
 
 With the rapid global urbanization, mobility challenges related to the transfer of passengers and cargo are escalating in cities. European Union calls for innovative research to develop a sustainable solution to the growing urban population and logistic demand. Crowdsourced delivery is an emerging concept and has been promoted as a promising solution. In a nutshell, it is defined as outsourcing a delivery task and can benefit all involved stakeholders. The carrier can earn an extra income during his trip by picking up and delivering an outsourced parcel. On the other hand, the courier company lowers its operating costs and increases efficiency. The overall benefit for the city is reducing traffic, less congestion and minimised environmental footprints of deliveries as compared to existing sollutions.  
 
 To facilitate the development of crowdsourced deliveries, this project aims at establishing and examining the concept of Crowdsourced Delivery as an Activity. The novelty lies in the fact that the delivery task is considered as a main or secondary activity in commuters' daily trip chain. The knowledge will then be created regarding the influential factors in motivating travelers to be a carrier of parcels preferable as a secondary activity so that the delivery tasks can be done in combination with the primary trip purpose. Courier companies can exploit the knowledge in providing the right incentive to the right people during their most suitable trips to engage as many citizens in delivery activities as possible.  
 
 This is a joint project with Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) under the EuroTech Alliance Program. It offers you a unique opportunity to collaborate with world-renowned researchers in TU/e under a secondment with a pre-agreed external research stay there at Professor Soora Rasouli's group as well as Assistant Professor Feixiong Liao.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 Your overall focus will be to develop models and solution algorithms for optimizing crowdsourced delivery services and conduct experiments to validate the models and algorithm. You will work with scholars and industrial partners with expert knowledge within various aspects of the field. You will be rooted in the Network Modelling group, a part of the Division of Transport, Department of Management. The division also consists of research groups within transport demand, machine learning for smart mobility, transport economics and transport psychology. You will be part of an increased effort in the integrated urban mobility system with other PhD students and staff in the division.  
 
 We expect you to have the interest and ambition to pursue PhD studies and experience working with mathematical modelling and programming.  
 
 You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.  
 
 Your background should be inin transportation, logistics, mathematical modeling, operations research, and/or programming, or related.  
 
 We furthermore expect 
 Good programming capabilities in any scientific language (e.g., C++, C#, Python, Matlab, Julia, etc.)  
 Good communication skills in English, both written and orally  
 Willingness to engage in group-work a multi-national team  
 
 
 Approval and Enrolment 
 
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules  
 
 Assessment 
 
 The assessment of the applicants will be made by the advisor team before 1 June 2022.  
 
 We offer 
 
 DTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice. We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment. We strive for academic excellence in an environment characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom tempered by responsibility.  
 
 In the Transport Division, we focus on improving mobility in relation to the three main challenges within this sector: 1) climate and environment 2) traffic congestion 3) traffic safety. We put numbers on traffic effects and the economic and societal effects using statistical analysis of transport behaviour. We conduct public sector consultancy for the Ministry of Transport and Housing and collaborate with transport companies and government agencies.  
 
 The division considers all scales within transport from the modelling of local pedestrian flows and bicycle traffic to international flight transport. We study all modes of transport both within passenger and freight transport. Our specific focus areas are green transport, electric cars and charging infrastructure, planning and optimization of public transport, bicycle traffic. Our research has a special focus on human behavior and we assess the socio-economic perspectives of transport, including policy instruments and welfare economic appraisal of transport projects.
