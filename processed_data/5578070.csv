The position is available from 1 September 2022 and is part of the research project ‘Life at the Furnace (LAF): Copper producing settlement ecosystems in the north-western Troodos, Cyprus’ funded by the Carlsberg Foundation.   Project description  The overall goal of the LAF project is to explain the complex human and environmental impacts of large-scale copper production during the foreign control of Cyprus under the Roman Empire from the 1st century BC to the 7th century AD. The project studies how the choices that supported copper production affected the landscape and living conditions and their sustainability. An in-depth study of food supply, agriculture, mining and forestry, imported goods and colonial relations will further reveal life at the furnace and place Cyprus within the economic network of the Roman Empire.   The successful candidate will be part of an international research group consisting of the Principal Investigator of the project, Associate Professor Kristina Winther-Jacobsen based at the Saxo Institute, University of Copenhagen, as well as researchers from the National Museum, Copenhagen; Uppsala University; Cyprus Institute, Nicosia; and University of Southampton. The PhD will be supervised by the Principal Investigator.   Job description  The PhD fellow will carry out independent research on heritage data from the Swedish Cyprus Expedition to Soli (1927-31) housed in the Medelhavsmuseet, Stockholm within the framework of LAF research questions. Soli is located in the Turkish occupied zone inaccessible to fieldwork since 1974. While stratigraphy, plans and architecture have been published (Westholm 1937; Gjerstad 1937), the ceramics have never been published in detail, and the character of the material culture of Roman Soli is largely unknown. The applicant is expected to make a detailed study of the Roman ceramics from Soli in the Medelhavsmuseet to map the exchange of material culture and thereby understand Soli’s role among the cities of Cyprus and in the Roman economic network.   Responsibilities and key tasks as a PhD fellow:     Carry through an independent research project under supervision.   Complete PhD courses or other equivalent education corresponding to approximately 30 ECTS.   Teaching and knowledge dissemination activities corresponding to approximately 30 ECTS.   Participate in the fieldwork of the LAF project (to include training in Cypriot material culture).   Participate in active research environments, including at least one stay in Sweden to study the SCE material held at the Medelhavsmuseet.   Write scientific papers aimed at high-impact journals (article-based dissertation).   Write and defend a PhD thesis on the basis of your project.     Qualification requirements  The ideal candidate will have a background in classical archaeology. We seek candidates with good interpersonal skills, the ability to organise work independently and the potential to produce high-quality research. Experiences with managing large datasets and familiarity with GIS is an advantage. Furthermore, good skills in spoken and written English and reading Nordic languages (archival data from the Swedish Cyprus Expeditions) are a prerequisite.   Admission requirements  To be eligible for the regular PhD programme, applicants must have completed a degree programme equivalent to a Danish Master’s degree (two years, 120 ECTS) in archaeology or a similar discipline. If the MA thesis is not completed at the application deadline, applicants must send pre-approval of their thesis.
