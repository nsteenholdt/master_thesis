We design technologies that cover a wide range of applications, such as smart cities and residential self-consumption, backup power systems in isolated areas, energy management, and grid balancing in renewable power production. We perform research in projects that aim to develop and integrate technologies and processes to create a new concept of an intelligent, modular, and scalable battery pack for a wide range of electric cars used in urban electromobility services, from mid-size electric vehicles to electric buses Other focus areas are the development of disruptive topologies for power converters using new semiconductor materials as well as cutting-edge digital technologies to improve architecture efficiency, power density, reliability, cost, and sustainability.   Similarly, we work on microgrid applications to help developing countries meet their climate neutrality goals by combining photovoltaic systems with biomass combined heat and power technologies coupled with electrical energy storage systems optimized for specific applications. We work in an international and multi-disciplinary setting in projects that integrate the expertise of different European partners in electrochemistry, electrochemical energy storage, electronics, process engineering, smart sensors, IoT, and solar power industries, aiming to decarbonize the energy and transportation sectors.   For more information, visit: Article:  Researchers aim to store wind energy in rivers flowing uphill Article:  Electric car of the future to be developed in Denmark Article:  Heavy trucks to run on electricity Article:  New copper batteries to store solar energy   Your qualifications For this project, we are looking for a highly qualified person with an electrical engineering background with a focus on power electronics for electrical energy storage systems, design of battery management systems or microgrid design, optimization, and implementation. The ideal candidate should be familiar with state-of-the-art standards and customized converter technologies for energy storage applications and have experience designing such systems, including component selection based on reliability, cost, simulations and testing. A background in the design of advanced battery management systems, controls and balance of plant is a plus. You should think out of the box, seek development opportunities, and love to be at the cutting edge of new technologies. Translating your knowledge and good craftsmanship into robust solutions is essential. The ideal candidate should hold a Ph.D. in electrical engineering (or equivalent), preferably with a specialization in the field of high power engineering or similar.   Required qualifications: Experience in power electronics Knowledge of control of power electronics (particularly DC/DC converters) Knowledge of battery storage technologies and battery management systems  Sound experience with scientific publication Excellent English skills, both oral and written   Who we are The  Section for Electrical Energy Technology  focuses on energy system integration and energy transition towards a more efficient, circular, and reliable energy system in the future. This includes coordinated planning and operation across multiple energy systems and renewable energy production, infrastructure, and consumption. The section is undergoing rapid expansion concerning educational and research activities, including seven large projects. In recent years, it has become the most important place of study in Denmark for the electrical power engineering area at the Bachelor’s level. The section has established the RESCUE laboratory –  http://www.rescuelab.au.dk/  – which researchers, students and companies use alike. The main goal of the laboratory is for researchers to gain practical experience with future energy systems based on the full integration of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, biogas, and storage systems. In addition, the group has expanded its activities to Aarhus University’s campus in Herning, where it has established the first “online” electrical energy technology degree programme, including a large energy technology laboratory.   Place of work The place of work is at Finlandsgade 22, 8200 Aarhus N, Denmark.   Additional information Further information about the position may be obtained from the project leader, Associate Professor Corneliu Barbu (phone no.: +45 9352 1325/email:  coba@ece.au.dk )   Application deadline The application deadline is 28 February 2025.   Application procedure Shortlisting is used. This means that after the deadline for applications – and with the assistance from the assessment committee chairman, and the appointment committee if necessary, – the head of department selects the candidates to be evaluated. All applicants will be notified whether or not their applications have been sent to an expert assessment committee for evaluation. The selected applicants will be informed about the composition of the committee, and each applicant is given the opportunity to comment on the part of the assessment that concerns him/her self. Once the recruitment process is completed a final letter of rejection is sent to the deselected applicants.   Letter of reference If you want a referee to upload a letter of reference on your behalf, please state the referee’s contact information when you submit your application. We strongly recommend that you make an agreement with the person in question before you enter the referee’s contact information, and that you ensure that the referee has enough time to write the letter of reference before the application deadline. Unfortunately, it is not possible to ensure that letters of reference received after the application deadline will be taken into consideration.   Formalities and salary range Technical Sciences refers to the  Ministerial Order on the Appointment of Academic Staff at Danish Universities under the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation .
