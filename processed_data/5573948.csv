 Job description 
 The Centre for Integrative Innovation Management is a cross-disciplinary research group where we focus on a set of issues within innovation management. We adopt a cross-disciplinary research approach because understanding and promotion of innovation from the initial idea to the fully commercialized or implemented innovation requires the combination of management, marketing, and technology. For more information on the Centre please visit the Centre  website. 
 The candidate is expected to conduct research within innovation management (IM). We are interested in candidates within IM and especially welcome candidates that have interests linked to our strategic priorities: 
 
 Innovation management theory and practice 
 Project management in innovative organizations 
 New and emerging technologies and commercialization  - including topics like emerging eco-systems, digital innovation, and digital transformation of organizations. 
 Health and Innovation  - including organizational opportunities and barriers to implementation of digital technologies in the healthcare system. 
 Sustainability and innovation  - including topics like innovation ecosystems, eco-innovation, green value chains, and sustainability management. 
 
 Successful candidates will have an international profile and a record of research publications preferably in globally top-ranked peer-reviewed journals and within dedicated innovation journals such as Research Policy, Journal of Product Innovation Management, Technovation, Industry and Innovation, and Creativity and Innovation Management. We welcome researchers with various methodological approaches, as we see the advantage in combining methods among the team members, to further the research programs. 
 Candidates should have a Ph.D. degree in social sciences (business economics, economics or similar) or a cross-disciplinary Ph.D. with a significant social science contribution. Once appointed, they will primarily teach in the wider field of innovation management and potentially in project management and market research in programs such as the graduate degree program Master in Project and Innovation Management, the B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Economics and Business Administration, and the M.Sc. (eng.) in Product Development and Innovation. The group is further in the process of creating a new graduate degree program, Master in Management of Technology, and the candidates are encouraged to specify if they have specific competencies or interests in contributing to our programs in life-long learning and continued education. 
 We expect successful appointees to contribute to the development of the Research Centre and to the department as a whole. The successful candidate is expected to be active in the social and academic life of the Department and participate in the guidance of doctoral students and junior faculty. Also, we expect active and constructive participation in the university's academic administration. To fulfill the requirements of the position, the appointee is expected to be physically present at the Centre on a regular basis. 
 The successful candidate preferably has experience with external research fund raising and application processes and has an interest in contributing to our ongoing efforts to secure funding. Ideally, the appointee has established strong ties with the international research community. Owing to the increasingly international focus of the degree programs, candidates must be able to teach in English. Furthermore, non-Danish candidates are expected to learn Danish. The University of Southern Denmark is the third largest university in Denmark. The university has consistently been ranked as one of the top 50 young universities in the world by both the Times Higher Education World University Rankings of the Top 100 Universities Under 50 and the QS World University Rankings of the Top 50 Universities Under 50. Overall, the university offers programs in five different faculties -- Humanities, Science, Engineering, Social Sciences, and Health Sciences - and incorporates approximately 35 institutes and 30 research centers.
