The successful candidate will work with our group to uncover new molecular concepts within our broader research area of in genetic innovation, genome regulation and germline biology of insects (mainly  Drosophila ). Promising projects with pilot data are available, but developing new ideas together is also highly encouraged. Strong support for further developing the candidates career strategy and a complementary strong research profile will be offered throughout the employment.   Duration and starting date The starting date is flexible within 2022 with the possibility to start as early as August 1st 2022.  Funding is available for at least 2 years of employment with extension possible for up to a total of 4 years.   Our aim We aim to uncover how germline genome biology shapes animal reproduction and evolution. This research holds to promise to impact basic as well as biomedical research. In this effort, we invert the textbook logic of genetic conservation and argue that young, rapidly evolving genes comprise an underexplored resource of exciting biological discoveries. We study such genetic innovation in the context of  genome regulation, germline biology and intragenomic conflicts . Our approach To understand this biology, we apply a diverse range of methods including cutting edge genetics in both  in vivo  and cell culture Drosophila systems, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, chemical genetics for time-resolved protein depletion, high-resolution microscopy, interaction proteomics and high-throughput sequencing for transcriptomic and genomic bioinformatic analyses. Several complementary approaches are pursued through on-going international collaborations.
