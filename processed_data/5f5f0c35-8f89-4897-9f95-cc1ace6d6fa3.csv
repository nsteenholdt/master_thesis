Novo Nordisk Foundation Quantum Computing Programme (NQCP) is establishing a talented and diverse international team to create a cutting-edge quantum programme in the heart of Copenhagen, Denmark. At the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, where the formulation of Quantum Mechanics was born 100 years ago, we aim to establish an international quantum computing programme, funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, that will drive research and innovations at multiple levels - from developing scalable quantum processor technologies to solutions for the quantum-classical control and readout interface, and all the way to quantum algorithms and applications.  The long-term mission of the programme is to develop fault-tolerant quantum computing hardware and quantum algorithms that solve life-science-relevant chemical and biological problems.     The project   We use ultra-cold atoms in optical traps to realize novel interaction-types that are useful in quantum simulation, computing and for the quantum sensing world.   You will lead the design and construction of a new experiment focused on the generation of atomic entanglement through high-cooperativity cavities.   As a postdoc in our research group you will become part of an ambitious and fast-moving research environment that wants to push the hardware architecture of neutral atom quantum computation to new levels and apply that understanding to the development of computational capability.   Who are we?   At the NQCP we operate with four hardware pilot lines pushing to develop efficient quantum computing on a range of different qubit platforms. The Neutral atoms pilot line is pursuing the use of neutral atom qubits trapped in optical lattices with controlled short-and long-range interactions. We are dedicated to push the boundaries of atom-based quantum computing systems and to integrate neutral atoms into future hybrid quantum systems. Our work on this currently focuses on     Cavity-based interaction systems   Developing novel and fast read-write schemes in neutral atom platforms   Analog quantum simulations for algorithm development   Collective interaction as a quantum memory resource       Who are we looking for?   We are looking for highly motivated candidates that have a skilled background in Physics, or Electrical Engineering. Experimental/computational competences and experience within quantum physics are important. We hope to get applications from great team-workers with loads of academic drive, a flair for building set-ups and experimental ingenuity.   The Scientific environment   We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in dynamic and international research environment hosted by the NNF Quantum Computing Programme (NQCP) at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen.   The postdoc’s duties will include research within atomic physics and quantum optics as well as teaching. The post may also include performance of other duties. The research will be led by Assistant Professor Stefan Alaric Schäffer ( schaffer@nbi.ku.dk ) and co-supervised by Professor Jan W. Thomsen.   Further information on the Department is linked at  https://nqcp.ku.dk/     The position is open from March 1st or as soon as possible thereafter.
