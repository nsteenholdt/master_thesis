Where you are asked for advice and for your contribution to solutions to professional challenges. Where the work-life balance is among the best in the world and where all employees receive free continuing education. We offer a meaningful job and beautiful surroundings to settle in. Lolland Municipality is looking for Social and Healthcare Assistants to replace a number of employees who are retiring. Lolland is a lovely place to live and work; a scenic island in the southern part of Denmark, with plenty of cultural offerings and with rich club life in sports, among other things. With only an hour and a half drive to Copenhagen, you can easily visit the capital whenever you want, while at the same time enjoy the much lower housing costs in Lolland. Our municipality is developing rapidly, not least because of the construction of the Fehmarnbelt link to Germany, along with a growing international community in Lolland Municipality. We meet citizens at eye level Working as a social and healthcare assistant in Denmark is something special. The work takes place both in care centres and in private homes. It works on the principle of 'helping people to help themselves', because being as self-reliant as possible improves people's quality of life. A concrete example of this could be that the social and healthcare assistant provides training for citizens who have just been discharged from the hospital to manage bathing and personal care on their own. You strive to give people content in their everyday life by knowing their life stories and talking to them about their memories. Thus, inclusiveness towards the citizen's way of living is important. In care centres, too, social workers and healthcare assistants seek to create a homely environment with meaningful activities. Tasks of a very different nature The scope of work is comprehensive and covers basic care and nursing, consultation and provision of guidance to citizens and their relatives as well as a number of nursing tasks such as pressure ulcer prevention, treatment of traumatic wounds, injections, medication dispensing, catheter care, ostomy care, palliative care and tube feeding.
