The selected candidate will contribute to the AUFF NOVA-funded project, DeepWater: Digital Twinning Perennial Traits for Resilient Agriculture. The main focus of the position will be to develop digital twins for deep water use by novel perennial grain crops such as intermediate wheatgrass. The chosen candidate will work on: Collecting high-time resolution data  on deep root traits, crop canopy dynamics, and water use efficiency of the perennial grain crops under wet and dry conditions at a field trial. Utilizing and validating digital sensors  (soil probe, drone data) for crop water use determination. Crop modelling (e.g.) APSIM  for perennial grain crops with a focus on water use efficiency by validating models using the collected high-time resolution datasets. Linking digital sensing technology  with model platforms (e.g. APSIM) using data fusion for improved daily model calibration. The postdoc will be part of a research environment focusing on the Green Transition of Crop Production.
