 Wolt is a Finnish technology company and we’re best known for our food delivery platform. We’ve grown significantly in the last three years, expanding our operations from just four countries across the Nordics, to 23 countries across Europe and Asia today. Our Finance team has played a key role in this journey - supporting our global operations from their central Helsinki hub has been no easy feat, but this group of dedicated and motivated professionals have made it seem effortless! As we continue to scale, we’re now looking for an experienced Country Controller to help us focus on our local accounting efforts in Denmark. You will sit with the local country team in Copenhagen but report to the Local Accounting Lead in Helsinki and work directly with the centralized Finance team. The Country Controller is responsible for local compliance and reporting, but as this is the first local accounting hire in Denmark, the role will also include setting up the local scalable accounting processes, while assisting the local teams with accounting related enquiries, such as payment follow-ups, explanations of reports provided to restaurant partners etc. What makes the Finance team so special is our ‘service first’ approach to the job - we enjoy creating strong communication loops with the wider business, so that bottlenecks are minimized and that things get done quickly and efficiently. Everybody is accountable for their own workload and takes pride in being meticulous and precise. We also enjoy learning and developing as we go - it’s important that you share this approach! :) What you'll be doing 
 
 Manage all aspects of Wolt Denmark Accounting; accurate and timely monthly reporting, annual financial statements and other statutory reporting required in Denmark 
 Responsible for creating fully reconciled financial position in Wolt Denmark

 Our humble expectations 
 
 Extensive experience with local statutory accounting- and tax compliance. 
 Solid background in relevant bookkeeping or accounting roles, preferably from a multinational company. 
 Masters degree in accounting or CPA / ACCA, or equivalent experience.
