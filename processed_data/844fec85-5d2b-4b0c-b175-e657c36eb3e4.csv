 The successful candidate must have a strong international profile and an emerging record of research and funding excellence as well as novel ideas with a clear potential to expand our frontiers of knowledge. 
 DIAS is growing, and this call is in fact the second of five calls: DIAS will hire a minimum of five research fellows at the Assistant Professor level per year for the next five years (2025-2029). We consider this a unique opportunity to hire top talent, to offer exceptional opportunities for outstanding researchers, and to attract “rising stars” to our ambitious and interdisciplinary environment.  
 The positions are joint positions at DIAS and a department at one of the five faculties at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The candidate will thus have two affiliations—DIAS and the department—and is expected to contribute to both. Tenure will be offered in the department with continued affiliation with DIAS.  
 In line with DIAS’s unique and ambitious research aims, DIAS Assistant Professors have reduced teaching obligations compared to a regular Assistant Professor position at SDU. Likely, the Assistant Professor will also receive startup or seed funding from the department, though this is subject to negotiation in the hiring process.  
 The starting date for the positions is August 1, 2025, or as soon as possible thereafter.  
 About DIAS  
 DIAS at SDU is a hub for interdisciplinary excellence at and beyond the frontier of knowledge, bringing together outstanding researchers from various disciplines to foster interdisciplinary research and innovation. It hosts Chairs and Fellows from all faculties of the university, fostering an interdisciplinary environment. DIAS encourages and supports curiosity-driven research and fosters the meeting of minds across disciplines and levels of seniority. The center cultivates an ambitious, open-minded and playful environment that nurtures both academic growth and a strong sense of community.  The candidate will be anticipated to contribute actively to DIAS, strengthening the bonds between the department/faculty on one hand and DIAS on the other, through interdisciplinary collaborations where meaningful. 
 For questions about DIAS, please contact DIAS Director Sten Rynning,  director-dias@sdu.dk . 
 In 2025 we are looking for an assistant professor in the following research area:  
 Translational biomedicine 
 We seek a candidate within translational biomedicine to do interdisciplinary research. The candidate will be part of the Department of Clinical Medicine. The existing strategic research areas at the department are within regenerative medicine, genomic medicine, bone research, and stem cell research see  https://www.sdu.dk/en/om-sdu/institutter-centre/klinisk-institut 
 The successful candidate will be responsible for developing a translational research program within any of the above fields where emphasis is placed on the ability to foster interaction between laboratory and clinical investigators and to build cooperative multidisciplinary teams ranging ideally from basic science approaches to designing and conducting early phase clinical trials. The conditions for establishing a group doing translational research will be optimal since laboratories will be linked physically to each other and to the new University Hospital in Odense in 2025.  
 The successful candidate must have demonstrated scholarly activities with achievements in translational research, a track record of peer reviewed publications in high impact journals, possess a potential for program development, and teaching and mentorship abilities. The candidate should show strong potential for independent funding or have an already visible track record of obtaining independent funding. The leadership of DIAS and the hosting Department will provide mentorship and support to the candidate.
