The PhD fellowship is financed by the Novo Nordisk Foundation Grand Challenge Program and by the Danish National Research Foundation (through funding of the IDUN Centre of Excellence to which the project is affiliated).   The fellowship is available from 15th August 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter.   Project description   The demand for peptide and protein therapeutics that can be used without injection is increasing. However, due to the structural properties of such biopharmaceuticals, it is extremely challenging to design drug delivery systems suitable for efficient delivery of therapeutic doses of, e.g., peptides after oral administration. Despite recent progress in the field of oral peptide delivery, there is still an unmet need to improve the translation from findings obtained  in vitro  to  in vivo  investigations.   This project will address the translation of promising findings from exploratory preclinical experiments to  in vivo  results. The project aims to design and critically evaluate drug delivery systems/dosage forms intended for oral peptide delivery and suitable for  in vivo  tests incorporating suitable functional excipients. The hypothesis is that by optimizing the combination of excipients with system design for specific peptide drugs, safe and efficient peptide delivery systems can be designed for future clinical tests. Design, characterization  in vitro,  as well as assessment  in vivo  will be done under the 3R-principles.
