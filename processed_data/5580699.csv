 A 3-year PhD position is available in the Neural Devices and Gas Photonics Group at DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark. Our group is seeking a highly motivated and talented PhD candidate willing to work on a challenging scientific project in a serious but also friendly and team-work oriented environment in the fields of neuroscience, fiber optics and material science.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 The overall focus of the project is the development of multifunctional neural probes capable of simultaneous optical stimulation, electrophysiological recording and photoacoustic imaging. The probes will be developed starting from multimaterial optical fibers based on soft polymers, which will be fabricated at DTU. In this framework, you will mainly focus on the validation of the fabricated devices in biological models.  
 
 Your responsibilities will include: 
 Contributing to the designing stage and fabrication of the multifunctional neural probes;  
 Validating the functionality of the probes in biological samples by conducting electrophysiological and imaging experiments in vitro and in vivo;  
 Developing the code needed for signal post-processing and spike sorting.  
 
 
 In completing with task, you will work side-by-side with colleagues having state-of-the art knowledge in material science, fiber technology and light-matter interaction in biological tissues. Part of the experiments will be conducted abroad, during a 1.5 year stay at MIT, USA.  
 
 Candidates should have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree in Biology, Biotechnology or Neuroscience.  
 
 They should also have: 
 Documented experience with in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological recording;  
 Substantial knowledge of immunohistology and imaging techniques for biological samples;  
 Substantial knowledge of coding and signal analysis, with a particular focus on the analysis of electrophysiology data;  
 Experience within the field of light-based techniques for neuromodulation;  
 Experience with surgical procedures on rodents;  
 An excellent academic performance record from a good scientific institution.  
 
 
 Candidates are required to have excellent communication skills in English (both written and spoken) and a proven ability to work independently, as well as to plan and carry out complicated tasks.  
 
 At the time of recruitment by the host organization, candidates must be in the first four years (full-time equivalent research experience) of their research careers, and have not been awarded a doctoral degree.  
 
 Researchers can be of any nationality. They are required to undertake transnational mobility (i.e. move from one country to another) when taking up their appointment. Nationality is therefore not a criterion.  
 
 Approval and Enrolment 
 
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules  
 
 Assessment 
 
 The assessment of the applicants will be made by Associate Professor Christos Markos  
 
 We offer 
 
 DTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice. We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment. We strive for academic excellence in an environment characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom tempered by responsibility.  
 
 Salary and appointment terms 
 
 The appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. The allowance will be agreed upon with the relevant union. The period of employment is 3 years.
