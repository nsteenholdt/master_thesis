Our group and research  This project will be carried out in the Bacterial Infection Biology (BIB) group at Costerton Biofilm Center. The BIB group offers a well-established platform for studying biofilm infections. We focus on the establishment of infecting biofilms, the cross-link between the host and infecting bacteria to improve diagnostics and treatment. The group conducts both basic and applied research on the molecular level as well as on a broader scale. The group consists of a broad variety of researchers with close collaboration to clinical departments. The position will be at the Department of Immunology and Microbiology, which is part of the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (SUND).   Project description  The PhD position is part of a project funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation ‘Persistent Bacterial Infections (PERFECTION)’. The project involves collaboration between UCPH, DTU and Stanford University. Persistent bacterial infections are a serious global health problem, affecting a broad range of people with diabetes, obesity, smokers, immune-compromised conditions, implants etc. In the clinic, the number of patients with persistent infections is growing.   This PhD project aims to generate knowledge of host-microbe interaction profiles in chronic wounds. In the project, wound samples collected from patients will be used for studying microbial and tissue transcriptomic profiles. The PhD candidate is expected to analyse sequencing data using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and perform microbiological experiments in the laboratory. We aim to answer basic biological questions about host-pathogen interactions as well as to identify potential infection biomarkers to improve diagnostics and/or treatment strategies. The project will be carried out in close collaboration with researchers working on patient sample collection and translational in vitro models.
