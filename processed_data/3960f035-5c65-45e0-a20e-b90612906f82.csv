Our research  You will be part of a research-team focused on evidence-based nature conservation and management of terrestrial habitats in Denmark and temperate Europe. We seek to impact practical conservation, by bridging between state of the art in science and practical nature management, based on excessive collaborations with nature managers in the public and private sector. We emphasize teamwork and collaborations both inside CMEC, within the project group, that also include researchers at Aarhus University, and with a global network of close collaborators. We strive to maintain a supportive and inclusive group where the experiences and skills of everyone help to build a productive, synergetic, and friendly culture and working environment.   CMEC is a centre of excellence with a cross-disciplinary research program. We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in a dynamic and international research environment addressing fundamental questions on the origin, maintenance, conservation, and future of life and biological diversity on Earth. The 40+ researchers at CMEC currently represent 14 different nationalities and the working language is English. The centre juxtaposes faculty staff scientists from the fields of macroecology, historical biogeography, conservation science, oceanography, evolutionary biology, community ecology, population biology, climate change research, and environmental economics.   Your job  The position is part of the NaturMål (“Nature goals/measures”) project led by Associate professor Jacob Heilmann-Clausen and funded by two private Danish foundations (Aage V. Jensens Naturfond, 15. Juni Fonden). The overall aims of the project is to explore how a dynamic ecosystem understanding can be integrated into evidence-based nature conservation. In the project, we intend to expand from traditional fixed conservation goals (e.g. specific target species or well-defined EU habitat types) to dynamic, “open-ended” goals without losing objectivity and measurability. The project is a collaboration with the Center for Sustainable Landscapes under Global Change, led by Prof. Signe Normand at University of Aarhus.    Your main tasks will be:   •    Daily project management, including oversight of project finances, timelines, and stakeholder engagement.  •    Responsibility for engagement and knowledge exchange with conservation practitioners and other stakeholders engaged in Danish nature management, in the private and public sector  •    Participation in the overall design and coordination of fieldwork associated with the project in collaboration with project partners at Aarhus University.  •    Participation in the design of review protocols and conceptual work in connection with a scientific investigation of the international state-of-the-art in monitoring of dynamic processes in Danish nature.  •    Lead writing on a handbook on goals and monitoring in Danish terrestrial nature.  Further, you will be expected to contribute to and support the ongoing research projects in the group on an ad hoc basis when needed; disseminate your expertise to new lab members and support the lab management.    Profile  We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic staff scientist with the following competencies and experience:   Essential experience and skills  •    MSc in conservation science, ecology, biology, or other environmental sciences  •    Deep understanding of ecosystem dynamics in temperate terrestrial ecosystems  •    Documented experience in monitoring of biodiversity, including field-based assessment of habitat structures and biodiversity  •    Knowledge and interest in Danish nature conservation  •    Proven experience with stakeholder contact (landowners, NGOs, official bodies, private sector partners) within conservation biology  •    Proven experience with the management of larger projects within relevant fields  •    Proficient communication skills and ability to work in teams  •    Good English skills, written and spoken  •    Good Danish skills, written and spoken, or a stated ambition to learn Danish, as the job involves interaction with stakeholders that are far from fluent in English    Desirable experience and skills  •    Experience with research within relevant fields  •    Experience from practical conservation work, including planning and habitat management.  •    Experience with steering project economy in larger projects  •    Experience with the planning of larger field sampling campaigns  •    Experience with international conservation policies, with a focus on restoration, habitat management and monitoring, e.g. within the Natura2000 framework   Place of employment  The place of employment is at Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate (CMEC) at the GLOBE Institute, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 15, 2100 Copenhagen Ø, Denmark.
