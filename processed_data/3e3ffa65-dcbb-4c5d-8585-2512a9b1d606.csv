The earliest possible start date is 1 October 2025.     The project is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation Data Science Ascending Investigator grant titled ""﻿CHEETAH: CHallenges of Evaluating Teams and Algorithms"" and is led by Associate Professor Veronika Cheplygina.   Project description  Machine learning (ML) competitions are often touted as drivers of algorithm development in healthcare but face limitations in real-world applications. An example competition is detecting lung cancer in chest images, where the team correctly identifying the most images with cancer wins the competition. Such competitions attract many international teams with monetary or prestigious incentives. While competitions are said to spur innovation, they often result in too similar algorithms that only excel on a specific accuracy metric, but are not robust and fail to generalize to diverse, real-world data.   I posit that a single performance metric such as accuracy is insufficient to capture algorithm robustness, for example how the algorithm performs on rare patient cases. Having a single performance metric also leads to too similar algorithms which do not bring added value despite their high training costs and carbon footprint. Furthermore, as research on women and other underrepresented groups in computer science shows, competition may deter them from entering or staying in the field.   I therefore propose to design competitions with multiple metrics, both in what the metric measures (e.g. accuracy or sensitivity) and which subgroups of patients this is measured on. My team will focus on two multimodal disease (risk) prediction data: chest x-rays with radiology reports and retinal images with tabular clinical measurements. Inspired by techniques like generative models, transfer learning and data distillation we will first develop novel methods to evaluate and increase the diversity of the evaluation data. We will then design how to evaluate similarity of algorithms, and develop methods to combine and reuse (parts of) them, such that robustness can be increased without the disproportionate carbon footprint. Finally, we will organize competitions in education and at conferences, where we will study how the novel design affects underrepresented groups in data science.   The candidates  The project aims to hire 2 PhD students and 2 postdocs. PhD1 will work on chest x-ray imaging and NLP data, PhD2 will work on cardiovascular imaging and tabular data. The postdocs will both work across the applications, respectively on data diversity / algorithm diversity. All team members will be involved in the studies on competitions in research and education.   Ideal candidates for the positions will have:     A finalized or close to completion MSc (for PhDs) or PhD (for postdocs) degree, in computer science, mathematics, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, mathematics education or another discipline with a strong computational component.   Experience with data management and reproducibility, programming in Python or similar   Experience with machine learning for imaging, NLP (PhD1), tabular (PhD2) or other types of multimodal data   Experience with research related to education and/or involving human participants is advantageous   For postdocs: experience with publishing in recognized journals, conferences or workshops   Experience with co-supervising MSc/PhD students is advantageous   Enthusiasm about interdisciplinary research in a diverse team     It is understood that even highly qualified applicants will satisfy these requirements to varying degrees, for example because of differences in countries and research fields. If you are interested in the project but are in doubt about checking these boxes, please contact Veronika Cheplygina before applying.   Research environment  The successful applicants will join the  PURRlab team  consisting of Associate Professor  Veronika Cheplygina  two postdocs and a PhD student working related projects within medical imaging and meta-science.   PhD1 (chest X-ray + NLP data) will be co-supervised by Rob van der Goot (ITU) and PhD2(cardiovascular + tabular data) will be supervised by Adam Hulman (Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus). Louise Meier Carlsen (ITU) will be involved as co-supervisor on the education part of the research.   The project also includes collaborations with Emory University School of Medicine (US), University of Bern (CH), Eindhoven University of Technology (NL) and the open-source platform OpenML.org.   There are multiple other opportunities for collaboration with other groups at ITU and a network of collaborations within and outside Denmark.   Here you can find some  reflections by foreign PhD students  from other research groups at ITU.   Data, Systems, and Robotics section  We are all part of the DSAR (Data, Systems, and Robotics) section at ITU. The DSAR Section at the IT University of Copenhagen conducts research in various aspects of infrastructure of data science, scalable and efficient systems supporting the data lifecycle, meta-science, artificial intelligence, robotics, and evolutionary computation, as well as a range of applications.
