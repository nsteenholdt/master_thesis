 Innoflow is a SaaS scale-up helping companies achieve diverse, inclusive, and high performing workplaces by enabling anonymous case-based assessment across the entire employee life cycle. Innoflow allows HR and Talent Acquisition to unbiasedly attract, acquire and develop talent based on each company’s current business challenges. That way, we help organisations achieve DE&I targets and find the right match for both candidates and companies. We believe that this is one way of creating the world that we dream of! By minimising the risk of conscious and unconscious bias, everyone with the right competencies gets the opportunity to show them off. 
 To achieve that, we need our software offerings to be fine-tuned, well designed and easy to use. On a daily basis, you will be working closely with our UX/UI Designer. The prospect of translating vision, mission, and business strategy into a visual design should sound appealing and challenging to you. 
 To become our new UX/UI Design Student Assistant, we will ask you to submit an anonymised, case-application. Working with the case will allow you to familiarise yourself with some of the tasks and challenges that you will face on the job. 
 What will I be doing? 
 Your ordinary day at work might differ depending on the project we're working on, and how far we are within the project's life cycle. Every project will be kicked off with a planning session, after which you will be assigned specific tasks to focus on throughout your week. You will be working independently most of the time, therefore you should be able to manage and prioritize your time efficiently. 
 The tasks can vary greatly, ranging from sketching flowcharts/wireframes to creating production-ready UI, which is why we expect you to be a problem-solver who has a keen sense of aesthetics. Furthermore, you will be working on existing UI improvements, preparing design material for developer handoff, and drafting UX copy. In addition to the previously mentioned tasks, you will also be responsible for communicating your design ideas to multiple stakeholders and providing them with ongoing updates. 
 This position is for you if: 
 🎨  you are a visual communicator 
 💡  you are a problem-solver 
 🔍  you are a detail freak 
 📐  you are good at Figma or any other design software 
 📈  you are open to receiving objective criticism and improving upon it 
 It is not crucial of you to have specific educational qualifications, X years of experience, or if you prefer to wear mis-matched socks to work every day. If you think that you’ve got the skills to succeed in the job, we encourage you to apply. 
 Before you rush on and check out the case, we would like to tell you a bit more about us and what you can expect. 
 What can you expect? 
 You can expect a team that is well-invested in the engagement and well-being of every employee. We value personal differences and have ongoing conversations to ensure everyone finds their tasks meaningful. 
 Innoflow is currently a team of 20+ team members of various nationalities, the majority working from our office in Copenhagen, close to Christianshavn Metro. Your primary place of work will be at the office. However, you will have the flexibility to work from elsewhere and outside of regular business hours if you wish to do so. 
 At the office, we eat lunch together every day, enjoy a good cup of coffee, engage in the occasional game of table tennis, and take a healthy break together every afternoon from 13:50-14:00. 
 Our remote tech team and a few other remote workers are not placed in Copenhagen or Denmark but are invited to our Summer and Christmas Parties. 
 Everyone is responsible for each other’s well-being. Therefore, we have a Culture C-Suite, where everyone has chosen what their unique contribution to the Innoflow-culture should be. For instance, we have a Chief Celebration Officer, who is responsible for festive events and a Chief Sports Officer, who tries to create a bit of friendly competition around the office. And don’t worry, if you aren’t into sports, you can find some comfort with our Chief Drinks Officer. We’re curious to see what your C-Title will be! 
 The practicalities 
 
 The job is 15-20 hours a week 
 You can start as soon as it fits into your calendar and ours. 
 There is free lunch, fruit, snacks, as well as tea and coffee. 
 The address for our office is Bådsmandsstræde 19B, 1415 KBH K. 
 You need to be able to read and write in English at a professional level. 
 
 About the recruitment process 
 You can solve the case whenever it fits your schedule as long as it’s before the submission deadline. We will review the case solutions ongoingly and whether or not you are among the final candidates, you will receive feedback on your case solution. All case solutions are deleted once the recruitment process is complete. 
 If you are invited to go further in the process, we will ask you to complete a personality test before an interview. 
 Submission deadline is the 29th of May 2022 at 23:59.  But we will assess the case solutions ongoingly as well as the interviews. 
 Should you have questions during the process, feel free to contact our UI/UX Designer Modestas at modestas@innoflow.io 
 We cannot wait to review your case answer!
