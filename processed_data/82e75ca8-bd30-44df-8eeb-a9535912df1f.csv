SI’s research is focused on strategy, innovation, entrepreneurship and international business. The department’s ambition is to host an internationally leading environment for research and teaching within the broad area of strategy. The department’s research is generally cross-disciplinary. Faculty members have backgrounds in management, economics, sociology and economic geography. The theoretical foundation for research in these areas is eclectic, combining strategy, innovation, and/or internationalization theory with insights from economics, sociology, psychology, and economic geography.  The department puts substantial emphasis on the solid application of scientific research method. The department has a pluralistic approach to research methods that includes, for example, formal theoretical models, quantitative empirical methods such as (lab and field) experiments, econometric applications to register data or survey data, as well as qualitative research methods. Core research areas of the Department include topics such as knowledge transfer, absorptive capacity, open innovation, university-industry interaction, outsourcing, internationalization, international management, patenting and licensing, high-tech entrepreneurship, firm founder characteristics, strategic human resource management, top management teams, social networks, labor mobility, innovation, team formation etc.  The number of staff at the department is approximately 80. This includes about 45 faculty members (professors, associate professors, and tenure track assistant professors), 7 administrative staff, and 30 members of staff who are hired on temporary contracts as research assistants, post docs or PhD students.

Among those, the department is home to the two most sought-after master programs at CBS, namely Management of Innovation and Business Development, and Finance and Strategic Management. The department is heavily involved in the different programs in shipping management and logistics on bachelor, master and MBA level, as well as master programs within biotech business and healthcare innovation. The position as associate professor is a part time (20%) 3-year research position. The main responsibilities will focus on research and development tasks that are related to the externally funded research project “Beyond Experimentation: AI-Driven Business Model Innovations in the Maritime Industry”. Responsibilities Driving research on digital transformation meeting high international standards, including responsibility for publishing, scientific communication and research-based dissemination. Academic development of the relevant discipline. Research management, initiation of research projects, supervision of PhD students, international research co-operation, reviewing for academic journals. Research education and further training of researchers, supervision of assistant professors and assessment committee work. Promoting CBS’s academic reputation. Initiating, fund raising and coordinating research projects. Promoting the research capabilities of Copenhagen Business School and other relevant assignments at Copenhagen Business School. Contributing to the administrative responsibilities of the research project. Communicating findings to the public in general and to CBS’s stakeholders in particular.
