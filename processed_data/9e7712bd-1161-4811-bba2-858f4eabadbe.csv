Funding is provided for doctoral candidates from both inside and outside Europe to carry out individual project work in a European country other than their own. The Intelli-Ingest MSCA Doctoral Networks is made up of 4 beneficiaries and 6 associated partners, all coordinated by the Biorobotics Institute of Scuola Superiore Sant‚ÄôAnna, Pisa, Italy. 
 
 The Intelli-Ingest Doctoral Network will train 13 researchers in the development of minimally invasive, orally delivered miniaturized devices. The program's key objectives include advancing the capabilities of ingestible devices by addressing current technical limitations, with a focus on improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing the need for additional interventions, creating environmentally sustainable devices, and developing simulators to reduce reliance on in-vivo testing. 
 
 The training network is interdisciplinary, integrating various fields such as physiology, electronics, robotics, microengineering, materials science, AI, and pharmaceutical science. The doctoral candidates (DCs) will receive comprehensive training through research projects, secondments, and interactions with industry and clinical environments, preparing them for diverse careers. 
 
 In connection with work package 1 ‚ÄúIngestibles for Therapeutics‚Äù, we are currently looking for three PhD students who will be working on 3 different projects in the section for Drug Delivery and Sensing (IDUN) at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). 
 
 In the IDUN section at DTU Health Tech, we have explored novel devices that can increase the systemic uptake of e.g. peptide drugs by facilitating an intimate contact between the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and the intestinal epithelium. As an example, we have developed a self-unfolding elastomeric foil which can be triggered in the small intestine ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2023.07.041 
 ). In broader terms, self-configurable devices are characterized by their ability to change shape to facilitate close proximity between API and the intestinal epithelium. For such devices, we aim for: 
 
 Project #1 
 ‚Äì Fabrication and formulation of micromotors, nanoparticles, and/or needles, that can be incorporated into devices for targeted drug release, better penetration to the intestinal mucosa, and increased exposure of the formulation to the epithelium. 
 
 Project #2  
 ‚Äì Developing mucoadhesive patches for enhanced retention and drug release in the intestine. Different materials and fabrication methods will be investigated, and different prototypes will be incorporated into devices. 
 
 Project #3 
 ‚Äì Design and fabrication of hydrogel-based kirigami/origami as a new model for self-configurable devices. In this project you will explore key design features necessary to promote close and effective interaction between newly designed ingestible devices and the gastrointestinal tract. 
 
 We offer a highly creative, collaborative, and ambitious work environment. These projects will be part of the IDUN research section, led by Prof. Anja Boisen at DTU Department of Health Technology. IDUN is a cross-disciplinary research section with over 50 members, that focuses on the development of micro and nanotechnology-based sensors, detection systems, energy materials and drug delivery devices. 
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 You should have a relevant educational background and preferably experience for the project you are applying for. Please indicate in your cover letter which position(s) you are applying for. ¬†Each project has specific requirements: 
 
 Project #1 
 ‚Äì You will be responsible for formulating, fabricating, and characterizing micromotors, particles, and/or needles, and integrating them into ingestible devices. A solid background in materials science, micro/nano fabrication, and solid formulations is essential, with a focus on shaping and combining materials into functional particles. Experience with drug delivery devices, micromotors, and in vitro/in vivo characterization is highly beneficial. 
 
 Project #2 
 ‚Äì You will be responsible for formulating, fabricating, and characterizing mucoadhesive patches to enhance retention and drug delivery in the intestine. A strong background in materials science and formulation is required, with a focus on integrating materials into functional patches. Previous experience with mucoadhesive materials/formulations, multilayer patch fabrication, and in vitro/in vivo characterization will be advantageous. 
 
 Project #3 
 ‚Äì You will be responsible for the design and fabrication of hydrogel-based kirigami/origami devices for oral drug delivery. A strong background in design, geometry fabrication, mechanical properties, and creativity is essential. Previous experience with materials and hydrogel-based device fabrication will be advantageous. 
 
 In addition to technical qualifications, all candidates should have general requirements as follows: 
 In accordance with the European Union‚Äôs funding rules for doctoral networks, applicants must NOT yet have a PhD 
 A willingness to work as part of a collaborative, interdisciplinary and international team, liaising with academic, clinical and industrial partners as needed 
 Good communication skills, with an interest in presenting research outcomes to a variety of technical and non-technical audiences 
 Proactive and self-motivated, taking the initiative in acquiring the skills and knowledge to achieve the objectives of their independent project and that of the overall team with a commitment to personal and professional development¬† 
 A willingness to embrace diversity, different cultural perspectives, and interdisciplinary approaches to research 
 Good English language skills 
 
 There are also some eligibility criteria that the applicant must fully comply with: 
 At the deadline date, applicants must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree 
 At the date of recruitment, applicants must have their Master‚Äôs degree or equivalent/postgraduate degree, which would formally entitle them to embark on a doctorate 
 At the date of recruitment, applicants must fulfil the transnational mobility rule: applicants must not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in Denmark for more than 12 months in the 36 months immediately before the recruitment date ‚Äì unless as part of a compulsory national service or a procedure for obtaining refugee status under the Geneva Convention 
 At the deadline date, applicants must be in the first four years (full-time equivalent research experience) of their research career (career breaks excluded) and not yet awarded a doctoral degree. Career breaks refer to periods where the candidate was not active in research, regardless of their employment status (sick leave, maternity leave, etc). Short stays such as holidays and compulsory national service are not considered 
 Applicants must be available full-time to start the program no later than September 2025 
 
 The work will be carried out within the framework of IDUN. In IDUN, our motto is ‚Äòbringing science to life‚Äô and we believe in openness, inclusiveness, having ambitions, making a difference and collaboration.¬† 
 
 You will play a role in the drug delivery part of the research section, interacting with several members working in different disciplines, such as physics, biology, microfabrication, chemical engineering, pharmaceutical science and polymer science. These projects are highly interdisciplinary, and we expect that you enjoy teamwork and are good at coordinating your work with colleagues. 
 
 You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.
