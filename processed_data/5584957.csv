The expected starting date is 1 September 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter. The duration for the positions is 3 years and they will both be (partially) associated with a new research project on research integrity. Who are we Research at The Danish Centre for Studies in Research and Research Policy is broadly concerned with a portfolio of empirical studies related to, but not solely considering research policy, innovation policy, and higher-education policy. The current research portfolio at CFA includes projects on innovation, quality in research and higher education, research funding, research integrity, gender in science, and responsible research and innovation. For examples of current research and consultancy activities, please click  here . Job description The position as postdoctoral researcher is a fixed-term academic research position. The postdoctoral positions are to contribute to the “ETHOS”-project, which is funded by the Carlsberg Foundation and led by Associate Professor Lise Degn. The successful applicants will work closely with the PI and a PhD student on the ETHOS project, but will also be expected to contribute to other relevant research projects and consultancy tasks at CFA. Teaching/supervision activities are also possible, though not required for the position. The ETHOS project focuses on research integrity and responsible conduct of research and examines how integrity policies are turned into practice in academic environments. Particularly, the project seeks to combine qualitative and quantitative methods in order to understand how integrity emerges as a problem, which solutions are attached to it and how this impacts scientific practices. Read more about the project  here .  Qualifications We hope to attract applicants with expertise within the areas of sociology, education, political science, science and technology studies or related fields, and with an interest in research integrity, Responsible Conduct of Research or Responsible Research and Innovation. A PhD is required, e.g. in social science or related areas. We expect the candidates to have high quality communication skills in spoken and written English, and be able to produce state-of-the art social-science research. The ETHOS project aims to explore how academic and public discourses shape the problem of research integrity and how such problematizations affect academic practices and perceptions. Therefore, it combines qualitative data collection and analysis (e.g. interviews and document analysis) with large-scale text analyses of scholarly literature and European policy documents (through combining qualitative coding, quantitative code, theme analysis, and natural language processing). This means that expertise within natural language processing,  or  policy analysis and/or qualitative methods could be an asset, although not demanded. In addition to a CV and proof of PhD degree (or near completion of a PhD degree), interested applicants should provide a 1-2 page application letter motivating why they are interested in the position and how they think they can contribute to the specific research project, e.g. in terms of some of the methodological skills mentioned above.
