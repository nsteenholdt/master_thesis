Enrolment will be at the Faculty of Social Sciences under Copenhagen Graduate School of Social Sciences.   The starting date is  1 September 2025.   Introduction  The PhD programme provides PhD students with strong research training which opens a window of opportunity to a variety of careers within the private and public sectors. The programme includes the drafting of a PhD thesis, active participation in research networks, PhD courses, teaching, and other forms of knowledge dissemination. The PhD programme can be undertaken as a three-year full-time study within the framework of the 5+3 study programme, or as a four-year full-time study programme within the framework of the 4+4 study programme.      Duties and responsibilities  Further information about the PhD study programme is available on the website of Copenhagen Graduate School of Social Sciences:  https://samf.ku.dk/phd-skolen/english/ .   Under ""Legal basis"" on the website you will find information about the rules and guidelines for the PhD programme and the Danish Ministerial Order on the PhD programme at the Universities.    Information about the PhD study programme is also available on the PhD website of the Department of Sociology. Please see:  https://www.sociology.ku.dk/phd-studies/ .   Applicants should familiarise themselves with the research strategy and the ongoing research at the department before submitting their application. Further information can be found here:  https://www.sociology.ku.dk/phd-studies/ .   Scholarship in the 5+3 or in the 4+4 PhD study programme    The 5+3 PhD study programme  In order to be eligible for a scholarship in the 5+3 PhD study programme, the applicant must have completed a two-year MSc degree programme or have earned 120 ECTS credits at an equivalent academic level before starting employment. Applicants should check the study programmes for more detailed descriptions of the entry requirements. PhD students are paid a salary in accordance with the agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations (AC). The PhD student has a work obligation of up to 840 hours over the 3 year period of time without additional pay. The work obligation can include teaching, for instance.       The 4+4 PhD study programme  Students who have completed a BSc plus 60 ECTS of an MSc degree programme would enrol as PhD students simultaneously with their enrolment in the MSc degree programme. Applicants should check the study programmes for more detailed descriptions of the entry requirements. Until an MSc degree is obtained, the grant is paid partly in the form of up to 48 state education grant portions (in Danish: SU-klip). More specifically the PhD student will be paid two grant portions per month plus salary for work (teaching, presentations etc.) which totals a workload of at least 280 hours. Payment and conditions of employment are carried out in accordance with the agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations (AC). Upon completion of the MSc degree programme, the student is transferred to the salary-earning part of the PhD studies. The PhD student is expected to seek funding for fieldwork as this is not included in the scholarship.     The qualifications of applicants with non-Danish Master’s degrees will be assessed to ascertain whether they correspond to the Danish level.
