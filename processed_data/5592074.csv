The position is a fixed-term full-time position for 48 months. We offer a vibrant international research environment where English is the preferred language in the laboratory, at meetings and at seminars. The Department employs some 450 people and covers a range of research areas within Biomedicine. We contribute to the Bachelor’s degree programs in medicine, molecular medicine, odontology and the Master’s degree programs in biomedical engineering and medical chemistry.

You can read more about the department  here  and about the faculty  here . About the research project Autophagy is a catabolic process highly conserved among eukaryotes, which is involved in the degradation of long-lived proteins, aberrant complexes and aggregates, dysfunctional and superfluous organelles, and intracellular pathogens. Structures targeted to destruction are sequestered by double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for turnover. The resulting metabolites are reused by the cell as either an energy source or building blocks for the synthesis of new macromolecules. Autophagy is essential to maintain cellular and organismal homeostasis because involved in the adaptation to stresses, quality control, metabolism regulation, cell development and differentiation, stemness maintenance, type II program cell death, tumor suppression and immunity. As a result, the impairment or defect in autophagy leads to severe pathologies such as neurodegeneration, myopathies, chronic inflammations, and some malignancies. Crucially, it has also been shown that autophagy is an effective therapy to prevent or cure diseases, including specific types of tumors, muscular dystrophies, and neurodegenerative disorders. The elucidation of the mechanisms involved in activation and regulation of autophagy, but also the identification of the proteins required for recognition and elimination of the various autophagic cargoes, is therefore of primary relevance. Understanding the exact role of autophagy in the various physiological situations and pathological conditions is also crucial. All this knowledge combined is essential to be able to modulate autophagy to the benefit of human health, but also for biotechnological and agricultural applications. The key actors of autophagy are the autophagy-related (Atg) proteins. A long-standing question in the field of autophagy is the origin of the membranes composing the autophagosomes. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been highlighted as the possible major lipid source as the autophagosomes form adjacently to it and their precursor structure, the phagophores, share membrane contact sites (MCSs) with the ER. The MCSs between organelles are established by specific proteins and one of the recognized MCSs’ functions is the transfer of lipids. We and others, have recently revealed that Atg2, a core Atg protein, plays a key role in establishing MCS between the phagophores and the ER. Since Atg2 transfers lipids between adjacent membranes  in vitro , these observations indicate that the Atg2 probably functions in supplying part of the membranes required for the autophagosome biogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying the establishment of these MCSs between the phagophore and the ER, and their function, remains laregely unknown. The main goal of the project is to decipher these two aspects of the phagophore-ER MCS by studying Atg2 and its interactors. At the MCSs, Atg2 forms a complex with Atg18 and associates to phagophores by interacting with transmembrane Atg9. Its binding partner at the ER, which is required for Atg2 to bridge the ER with phagophores, remain elusive. Thus, we will take two unbiased approaches to identify new Atg2 interactors before investigating their role in autophagy and phagophore-ER MCSs  in vivo . In parallel, we will study  in vitro  the tethering and lipid transfer functions of Atg2, and dissect the role of the known and newly identified binding partners in these processes. The investigations, which will use a unique combination of cell biological and biochemical approaches, will take advantage of yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  because of the experimental amenability of this model system, including the possibility to purify proteins for the  in vitro  assays, and the presence of a single isoform of Atg proteins. Altogether, the results will shed light into a step of autophagy that has only marginally been studied. The outcome of this project will be the deeper understanding of the role of the connection between phagophores and the ER. This will provide ground-breaking knowledge about the mechanism of autophagy, and may provide important information for the development of future autophagy-based treatment of diseases.
