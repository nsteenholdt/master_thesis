Candidates should have strong background in biochemistry, cellular/molecular biology and cell signaling with extensive experience in research field related to metabolism and energy homeostasis. The position is a 2-year position to start July 15, 2022, or after agreement.   Background  The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research’s vision is to strengthen interdisciplinary research that transforms our basic understanding of the mechanisms that underlie metabolic health and disease, and to accelerate this knowledge towards new prevention and treatment strategies. We were established in 2010, and in 2017, we moved into new laboratories, offices and meeting rooms in the Maersk Tower  www.maersktower.ku.dk .   The Center has around 260 employees who work in an international, highly collaborative research environment across a range of biomedical disciplines. You can read more about us here:  www.cbmr.ku.dk .   Our group and research  The Sakamoto Group investigates fundamental molecular signalling mechanisms that control energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis associated with exercise, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.You can read more about the Sakamoto Group  here .   Project & your work  Cellular adaption to nutrient and metabolic stresses such as starvation and exercise are critical for the maintenance of organismal homeostasis. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of energy homeostasis and a promising drug target for treatment of metabolic disorders. We have recently identified that Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, is a downstream target of AMPK in various cells/tissues including muscle and liver. The successful candidate will conduct experiments to elucidate 1) the molecular mechanism by which AMPK regulates TFEB, and 2) investigate functional roles that AMPK-TFEB axis play in the context of cellular metabolism and adaptation using genetic and pharmacological tools in both cellular and tissue/whole-body levels.   Profile   We are looking for highly motivated and enthusiastic researcher who have the following skills and qualifications:     PhD in Biology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Molecular Biomedicine, or related sciences   Profound knowledge on energy metabolism, protein kinase regulation/signaling, enzymology and biochemical assays   Proven track record in relation to career stage (at least one first authored publication in an internationally recognised peer-reviewed journal)   Experience with preclinical studies is a plus    Proficient communication skills and ability to work in multi-disciplinary teams   Experience in supervising other researchers at different levels   Excellent English communication skills, both written and spoken     Place of employment  The place of employment is at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Maersk Tower, Panum Institute, University of Copenhagen. We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in a dynamic and international research environment.   Terms of employment   The employment as postdoc is a full time and fixed-term position for 2 years. Starting date is July 15, 2022 or after agreement.   Salary, pension and terms of employment will be in accordance with the agreement between the Ministry of Finance and AC (Danish Confederation of Professional Associations). Depending on qualifications, a supplement may be negotiated.   Non-Danish and Danish applicants may be eligible for tax reductions, if they hold a PhD degree and have not lived in Denmark the last 10 years.
