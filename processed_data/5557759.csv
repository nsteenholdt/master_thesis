 Oh, hey there movie star! 👋 As a part of our expanding video content team, we're on the lookout for an outgoing and creative soul with a lot of charisma to help us produce and, most importantly, host a highly inspiring video content universe for all our German-speaking yarn-lovers!  
 You'll join a dedicated team of 5+ Hobsters, who all strive to inspire our worldwide yarn community and make sure we express the Hobbii brand and design identity in a way that is meaningful and compelling via video content on YouTube and our highly succesful weekly Yarn Bingo (yes, you heard that right!) as well as other platforms. 🧶 
 In this role as a Video Host you’ll be hosting our online yarn bingo and live shopping events, produce how-to content about knitting and crochet, and generally represent Hobbii in videos and live events - mainly for the German market. In other words, presenting and being in front of the camera is where you shine!  🎥  An important part of our strategy is to be more than “just” a shop. You will be essential in this journey! 🚀 
 But hold on, this takes courage and imagination!  Why? Because you’ll get to build and shape our German video presence in close collaboration with our incredible team of current Hosts & Video Producers. You'll report directly to our Chief Experience Officer! 
 What you'll be doing; 
 
 Be our on-screen host for our weekly online bingo and live shopping events in German and English 
 Produce knitting and crochet technique how-to videos - both behind the scenes and in-front! 
 Become the ""face of the franchise"" and a Hobbii ambassador for the German and English-speaking community. 
 
 We'd be thrilled if you; 
 
 Speak German and English on a fluent level 
 Just absolutely love to knit and/or crochet - and teach others as well! 
 Are the next Meryl Streep in front of a camera (who are we kidding, there is no new Meryl - but less will do just fine!) 
 Are able to work some evenings and weekends 
 
 Although not a must, we'd also love it if you; 
 
 Speak Danish as well as German and English 
 Have experience producing video for YouTube, Twitch or similar platforms, both behind and in front of the camera 
 Are a content creator by heart who has that constant urge to create 🏗 
 
 Does it sound like you? 
 Spot on - or almost? We’d love to hear from you whether you have more or less experience than what we've listed above. Just like Hobbii, our roles grow and can be flexed to fit. 
 Our promise to you 
 Working at Hobbii should be exciting, fun and meaningful. We achieve this by hiring talented and ambitious people who fundamentally believe that we’re better together. We have a dedicated People & Culture team whose job is to make sure going to work doesn't suck. Join us if you love to experiment, learn something new and be playful at work. Also, you'll get to see that our 400 Hobsters know how to throw some pretty great parties! 
 This position is based in our brand new HQ in Dortheavej, Copenhagen where we offer brekkie, yummy lunch, themed Friday bars and damn good coffee.
