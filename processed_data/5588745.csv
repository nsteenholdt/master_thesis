 We are now looking for up to three PhD students, who have excelled in their studies, to join our team, working towards new and highly ambitious research goals at the forefront of this new field. Our research addresses multiple areas and spans quantum optics, solid-state physics, nanotechnology, mathematical modelling, inverse design, integrated photonics, semiconductors, nanofabrication, and spectroscopy. See, e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01681 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06305 for our latest experimental breakthroughs, theoretical insights, and scientific background for the present positions. We aim to combine fundamental theory, device design, and our unrivalled capabilities in high-resolution silicon nanotechnology towards entering so far uncharted experimental regimes. The currently available projects include:  Quantum nonlinearities.  
 Optomechanical and Casimir interactions.  
 Light emission from hot electrons.  
 
 
 The successful candidates will interact with a dedicated team of highly motivated researchers, where we emphasize strong interaction between experiment and theory, independent thinking, and team spirit.  
 
 Responsibilities and tasks

 NanoPhoton 
 
 The research vision of NanoPhoton - Center for Nanophotonics - is to explore the hitherto inaccessible regime of extreme dielectric confinement of light in optical cavities and to apply the associated enhanced light-matter interaction to solve fundamental outstanding challenges in chip-scale quantum and information technologies. To this end, we will develop the science and technology for a new class of optical nanostructures by combining fundamental electromagnetic and quantum optical theory with state-of-the-art nanofabrication and advanced experiments. https://nanophoton.dtu.dk/  
 
 The Nanophotonics Section at DTU Fotonik 
 
 DTU Fotonik has 210 employees and is one of the largest research centers in the world focusing entirely on photonics. Research is performed within nanophotonics, photonic nanotechnology, lasers, quantum photonics, optical sensors, LEDs, photovoltaics, ultra-high speed optical transmission systems, and bio-photonics. The Nanophotonics section combines expertise in the synthesis and handling of nanomaterials, the fabrication of nanoscale devices, and theoreticians employing a wide palette of analytical and numerical techniques to provide better understanding of and control over the fundamental properties of light-matter interactions and in this way realizing new nanophotonic devices for emerging information and quantum technology.
