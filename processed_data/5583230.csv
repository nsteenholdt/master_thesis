 Biomanufacturing is one of the fastest growing fields and a driver for the transition from a fossil-based to a circular bio-based economy and a sustainable future. If you would like to become an expert in this strategically important interdisciplinary field and contribute to the green transition, we have an opportunity for you.  
 
 The departments of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering and the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (CfB) at the Technical University of Denmark offer a position as a PhD student in the field of downstream processing of biologically-produced compounds. The project will address the question of how to develop efficient extraction and purification of new molecules produced by cell factories, covering the whole spectrum from process design to scale-relevant production and purification. This position will be hosted at the Center for Process and Systems Engineering in close collaboration with the Systems Environmental Microbiology laboratory at CfB working with separation and purification unit operations, particularly solid-liquid extraction, at lab and pilot plant scale. This PhD project is part of the PhD Program of the Fermentation Based Biomanufacturing (FBM) Initiative at DTU where we educate true biomanufacturing experts with interdisciplinary competences in cell factory-engineering and process engineering with a strong focus on industrial applications.  
 
 The FBM Initiative is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, and under this initiative, scientists from DTU Chemical Engineering, DTU Bioengineering, and the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability work together to engineer new or optimized production hosts or processes and solve the interdisciplinary challenges of large-scale bioproduction. The FBM Initiative's research infrastructure includes a well-equipped fermentation core with an automation and high-throughput micro-fermentation unit, a pre-pilot plant and a pilot plant. Located in the Copenhagen area, one of the world's strongest biotech hubs, DTU's FBM Initiative offers a unique and internationally leading education and research environment with exceptional conditions for biotech career starters.  
 
 This is one of 7 PhD student positions available on the FBM PhD program this year. The expected starting date is 1st of July 2022.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 Your overall focus will be to strengthen the department's competences within the field of downstream processing, with special focus on the development of novel or improved solid-liquid extraction strategies for separation or purification of intracellular products after fermentation. You will work with nearby colleagues, and with both academic and industrial partners in Denmark as well as abroad.  
 
 Your primary tasks will be to: 
 Explore and develop new methods or strategies for solid-liquid extraction and separation of commercial products contained in bacterial cells after fermentation at different scales.  
 Design process for high-yield recovery of biocompounds in a green and sustainable fashion.  
 Operate pilot plant equipment and optimize conditions towards recovery and purification of the targeted compounds  
 Teach and supervise B.Sc. and M.Sc. student projects.  
 
 
 You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) on Chemical or Biochemical Engineering or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. The candidate must have previous experience in downstream processing or handling of unit operations, preferably extraction, and preferably at lab and pilot plant scale. Previous experience with handling bio-based compounds and/or purification protocols will be also positively assessed.  
 
 Approval and Enrolment 
 
 The scholarships for the PhD degree are subject to academic approval, and the candidates will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see the DTU PhD Guide. http://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules/PhDguide  
 
 Assessment 
 
 The applications will be assessed based on the qualifications, academic and personal skills of the candidates.
