We stay humble: we give back through charitable projects. 
 Our ambitions are big, and with our talented and passionate team, we know we can make them a reality.  
 Join us.  
   
 The Role 
 This role is about strengthening our brand presence, engaging our audience, and driving growth by developing and executing impactful social media strategies and managing influencer partnerships. You’ll craft compelling content, build genuine relationships, and expand our brand's reach and influence in the digital landscape. 
 You'll be collaborating closely with a diverse group of talented individuals both within and beyond our marketing department. Together with our creatives and project coordinators, you’ll ensure that our brand message is consistent and resonates with our audience across all digital marketing channels such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok. 
   
 What You’ll Be Doing 
 
 Hold the responsibility for our Content Management, selecting content that resonates with our target audience and aligns with our identity.

 Occasionally contributing to creating visuals, graphics, or short videos to support campaigns, promotions, or trending topics. 
 Planning and executing digital social media campaigns and sponsored posts. 
 Tracking and reporting social media performance using analytics tools. 
 Managing influencer relationships by identifying and evaluating potential influencers for partnerships.

 Engaging with our social media communities by responding to comments, messages, and mentions on the channels we use. 
 
   
 What You Offer: 
 You’re a self-starter who takes full ownership of your tasks, thriving in a fast-paced work environment. A social animal who loves to interact and build connections with our online community. With solid experience and a keen understanding of the ever-evolving social media landscape, you stay ahead of trends. You don’t just follow trends—you understand them and use them to keep our brand at the forefront. 
 Your structured and strategic approach ensures seamless planning and execution of social media postings. With an eye for detail and creativity, you can create engaging content directly from your iPhone, turning ideas into impactful visuals and messages that resonate with the audience. 
 We are also looking for someone who has: 
 
 3 years of proven experience on a professional level in social media management. 
 In-depth knowledge of major social media platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok) 
 Skills in content creation on a mobile phone “on the go”, and basic video editing. 
 Experience in working with paid content and the distribution of a budget to maximize outcomes. 
 Strong understanding of social media trends and analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Insights, Buffer, Meltwater, etc.) to measure and track campaign performance. 
 Ability to think creatively, generate innovative ideas, and adapt to a rapidly changing social media landscape. 
 Strong organizational and project management skills, with the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously and meet deadlines. 
 A great team player who is ambitious and stays humble, just like us. 
 
 If there are a couple of things from this list that you feel you’re missing, please do apply anyway. A passion for learning and a great personality is just as important to us as experience 
   
 What we offer 
 Our culture is one of the key reasons that we’ve grown from two people with a side project to an international brand with a team of 100, so retaining a friendly, vibrant, and down-to-earth atmosphere is crucial to us for the future.
