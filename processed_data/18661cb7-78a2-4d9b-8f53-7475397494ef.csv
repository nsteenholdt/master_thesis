The timely data driven response to virus infections in livestock requires the maintenance and analyses of the continuously generated sequencing data from virus infection sites in a fast and reproducible manner. The national Danish swine and avian influenza surveillance data has reported increasing virus outbreaks over the last years. To strengthen the efforts several criteria needs to be met ranging from standardized and automated data analysis to analysis of biological and evolutionary processes of vector borne viruses. This will include the latest input to be used for both quick response at virus outbreaks, continuously updated vaccine candidates and understanding of relevant parts of the biology relevant in other virus contexts. The project will be jointly supervised by Associate Prof Stefan Seemann and Prof Jan Gorodkin and will be in close collaboration with the Veterinary and Zoonotic Virology group at the IVH department. The position is funded by the Veterinary contingency program of the UCPH.   Start date  is  7 May 2025  or as soon as possible thereafter.   Our research and research group  The bioinformatics group has a strong profile in data analysis, algorithm development and in building bioinformatic tools, many involving computational RNA biology also relevant for this position.

Our research environment is highly dynamic and international and stimulating with a wide range of activities from seminars, workshops, summer schools and retreats.   The project  The project will develop a toolbox for the analysis of genomic sequencing data taking into account variance, phylogeny, viral transmission pathways, and generation of viral vaccine candidates. Furthermore, an analysis of host-virus interactions and genome-wide RNA virus structures will be conducted.   Your key tasks as a postdoc at SUND will be to:   • Develop the relevant bioinformatical methods from design to implementation.   • Collect and analyse viral genomic and host-virus transcriptomic data.   • Apply the computational tools within the framework of the national Danish swine and avian influenza surveillance data.   • Explore further possibilities for improving the computational methods and modelling.   • Teach and disseminate your knowledge.
