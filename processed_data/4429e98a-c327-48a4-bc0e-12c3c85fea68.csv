The PhD position is part of a research project funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark: ‘ PhageX : Next-generation bacteriophage therapy for treating gut-related diseases’ ( https://dff.dk/en/apply/supported-research/research-leaders/research-leader-2023/torben-solbeck-rasmussen )   Start date is 1 April 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project   During the last decade it has become evident that a range of complex diseases are associated with gut microbiome (GM) imbalances, amongst other metabolic syndrome, colon cancer, autism spectrum disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This makes the GM an attractive therapeutic target for faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), but widespread use of FMT is unlikely due to inconsistent treatment outcomes and the risk of infection by bacteria and human viruses that are transferred along with the donor material. Recent studies point at the bacterial viruses (bacteriophages, in short phages) as the driving element for successful FMT. The  PhageX  project is based on the bold hypothesis that phage transplantation not only can have same effect as FMT, but it can also be transformed into a reproducible production of safe phage therapeutics that warrant low risk of infection of pathogenic bacteria and human viruses from the donor material. Both  in vitro  simulations of gut conditions and animal models will be applied to evaluate the methodologies. Although IBD will be used as a proof-of-concept case,  PhageX  will open a myriad of possibilities to cure various GM-related diseases with minimal risk for the patient and thereby replacing FMT with a next-generation phage-mediated therapy.   The project is built on an exciting collaboration between Tallinn Technical University, Estonia, Amsterdam UMC, The Netherlands, Section of Experimental Animal Models at the University of Copenhagen.   Specific tasks for the PhD position in  Gut Ecology and Phage Delivery Engineering     Develop a method for gentle encapsulation of bacteriophages   Chemostat fermentations of intestinal content   Working with  in vitro  intestinal models   Creating a protocol for improved matchmaking between donor bacteriophages and recipient gut microbiome   In vivo  animal studies and collection of samples. It is noted that the assistance from experienced personnel will be provided as required until ABD license in laboratory animals science have been obtained   Gut microbiome analysis   Initiating your engineering creativity     Who are we looking for?   We are looking for candidates within a relevant field, such as biotechnology, biology, pharmaceutical science and material science.   Our group and research- and what do we offer?   The selected PhD fellow will be part of the Section of Microbiology, Gut Health, and Fermentation. We are located in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen.    The section currently has ~50 members and offers an open, supportive environment for everyone to thrive. There will be a strong focus on work-life-balance. Currently there are ~18 PhD students in the section representing many different nationalities, which provide a friendly and useful network for the PhD students. At both department and university level there are also yearly social and career relevant events targeting PhD students. You will also be part of our exciting social events in the section. As a member of the group, you will participate in our biweekly section meetings, where you will have the opportunity to present your work in a safe environment and engage in scientific discussions relevant to our field.    In the section we work on a range of topics that range from gut health, food fermentation and starter culture functionality, food preservation and spoilage including biocontrol, microbial food safety and hygiene, gut microflora and probiotics in humans and animals, and microbiological quality assurance. The department hosts comprehensive infrastructure, well-equipped facilities, and extensive experience in phage biology, colloid research for food properties, and microbiome investigation over decades. While expertise in anaerobic culturing for microbiome studies have been developed the last decade, utilizing e.g. anaerobic chambers and Hungate systems. Additionally, the department is equipped with an in-house  in vitro  colon model, the CoMinigut, that are used for assessing dietary influences on gut microbiota and metabolite production. The presence of four sets of 2L Sartorius Biostat A bioreactors underline the ability to carry out controlled fermentation experiments. Moreover, our state-of-the-art gut virome pipelines, encompassing sample preparation and analysis, include a robust third-generation sequencing setup, built on Oxford Nanopore technology. Collaboration extends beyond Food Science, with several clinical partners specializing in gastrointestinal diseases as well as experts in animal models, that offers all required facilities.
