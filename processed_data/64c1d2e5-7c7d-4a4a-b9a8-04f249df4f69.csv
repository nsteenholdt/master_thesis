 Moonboon was founded in 2019 by Marie when she had her first son. She tried a baby hammock and realized that she needed to sit next to it and rock it for 4-5 hours a day while her son slept. This gave her the idea for the motor. Since then, many products have been developed, and today Moonboon is a dynamic company bringing better sleep to over 70 countries worldwide. The company strives to be an integral part of every child’s sleep routine by offering safe and reliable products to parents. 
 Moonboon’s products are developed in close collaboration with experts and engineers and designed with a Scandinavian aesthetic that ensures safety, sustainability, and a timeless design. Since 2019, the product portfolio has grown to include more than 40 different products. 
 Moonboon’s vision is to become a trusted partner and a preferred brand for parents seeking to improve their child’s sleep. Their vision includes integrating advanced IoT and AI technologies into their product design and development. Built on a foundation of respect and trust, Moonboon fosters a supportive work environment where personal and professional growth are prioritized. 
 About the Department 
 As Hardware Development Lead, you will join Moonboon’s Product Development Department. The department’s goal is to create innovative baby sleep solutions. From concept to launch, they develop products that prioritize safety, comfort, and quality, ensuring a great experience for families. 
 The department operates in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment. You will collaborate with colleagues who excel in solution, functionality, and design thinking, but they do not necessarily have deep technical expertise. Weekly stand-up meetings are held to review progress, address challenges, and plan for the future. 
 About the Position 
 As Hardware Development Lead, you will play a key role in developing hardware solutions and IoT-enabled products. The role encompasses three core areas: stakeholder management, project management, and development, leveraging your understanding of hardware, software, and firmware. 
 In this position, you will be introduced to new products and ideas, requiring you to manage multiple concurrent tasks while maintaining a clear focus on priorities. You will work on exciting projects such as developing Moonboon’s baby monitor and optimizing the cost of their Tripod Stand. You will be responsible for coordinating, prioritizing, and managing projects from concept to final product. This includes finding innovative solutions, creating detailed requirement specifications, and ensuring that products meet Moonboon’s high-quality standards. 
 A significant part of the role involves collaborating closely with suppliers and manufacturers, communicating clear requirements, and ensuring timely delivery of products that adhere to the specifications. Your goal-oriented and investigative approach, combined with the ability to provide constructive feedback and push back when needed, will be critical to your success in this role.  
 The position requires not only strong project and stakeholder management skills but also a strong technical knowledgebase. You will engage directly with beta testing and consumer feedback to refine products and ensure they meet user expectations.  
 Responsibilities 
 
 Lead the innovation of hardware solutions, focused on the development of innovative consumer products. 
 Take ownership of the product lifecycle – from concept to market launch – ensuring projects are delivered on time and within budget. 
 Collaborate closely with internal and external stakeholders. 
 Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations throughout the lifecycle in collaboration with the compliance department.
