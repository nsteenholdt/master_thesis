Project description   Our laboratory has recently developed technology for identifying and synthesizing the chemical messenger molecules responsible for quorum sensing and crosstalk between staphylococci within the microbiome. These messenger molecules are called autoinducing peptides (AIPs). In this interdisciplinary and highly collaborative project, funded by Sygeforsikringen “danmark”, we will perform a substantial structure–activity relationship (SAR) study, building on our novel discoveries, and start to investigate the potential importance of bacterial cross-communication within the gut microbiota. Your tasks will thus include synthesis, assay development, and biological compound evaluation, including significant amount of work performed in the laboratories of our collaborators at Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UCPH) and at Scripps Research in La Jolla, CA, USA.   Principal supervisor  Professor Christian Adam Olsen, Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology   Start  1 May 2025   Duration  3 years as a PhD student   Our group and research   With a foundation in chemical synthesis, the Olsen Lab seeks to explore the function of small molecules, peptides, peptidomimetics, and proteins in biological systems. Thus, working in the interdisciplinary interface between chemistry and biology. We are focusing on peptidomimetic secondary structures with potential for supramolecular assembly and multivalent display. We are also exploring naturally occurring macrocyclic peptides and analogues thereof for development of class- or isoform-selective HDAC inhibitors and quorum sensing modulators, as well as investigating substrate-specificity of the human lysine deacylase enzymes using chemical biology tools. The laboratory is currently comprised of about ten M.Sc. students, Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral fellows of diverse nationalities, with backgrounds in chemistry, biochemistry, and engineering. We take pride in working as an inclusive team and we have a balanced gender composition.   Our department   The Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology is committed to research-based education and interdisciplinary research that supports the development and understanding of chemical and pharmacological properties of drugs and drug targets at the highest level for the benefit of society.
