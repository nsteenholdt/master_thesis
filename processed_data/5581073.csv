Rotor diameter has grown with approximately 3.8m/year, and as the rotor gets bigger, the rest of the turbine’s components grow similarly. This evolution means that the value chain of wind turbine manufacturing is more frequently challenged by increasing size, weight and complexity. Correspondingly, transport of larger and heavier items is becoming a very big issue. Different places in the world there are restrictions on what times of the day where it is allowed to transport the components, there is restrictions on which roads we must use and what kind of transport, whether it is by truck, train etc. The cost of such transports becomes very expensive, and in a market where price per MW, is decreasing, we get increasingly challenged to find a way to reduce the cost in our value chain. One of the options to cope with these challenges is to move the manufacturing of the modules closer to installation site, and in a controlled environment to assemble such modules locally. A main characteristic of mobile manufacturing systems is that they are able to be moved geographically to different locations. It has been argued that such a capability is important to cope with global competition, improve manufacturing sustainability, and reduce delivery times for mass customisation production. However, new industrial paradigms such as Industry 4.0 makes little if any notice of mobile manufacturing but instead focus on the digitalisation of fixed location factories. We are therefore looking for a talented Post-Doctoral Researcher that will work together with our industrial partners into researching and accelerating the adoption of modelling and simulation tools for the support of mobile manufacturing. Our vision is to develop a digital twin solution that can demonstrate establishing and (re)configuration of a movable factory solution that can be moved around the world so the assembly processes for a specific case study. We aim at demonstrating that the setup costs and manufacturing floor planning can be substantially reduced through the application of digital twin technology.

In recent years, these research groups have seen close cooperation between different research groups around the world. As a post-doc, you are a valuable part of the researchers at the department. All post-docs get support from experienced advisors outside their own research group. The main purpose of the support group is to give feedback on the PhD work to help you reach your full potential as PhD student, and to ensure that any obstacles that may arise are overcome as smoothly as possible. Another important aspect is socializing with your peers across the department. Social events are continuously organized by the department and student clubs. Aarhus University was founded in 1928.
