Our current research focus concerns proteins involved in matrix degradation (during cancer invasion and metastasis) and in intravascular lipid metabolism. The successful candidate will be responsible for maintaining and developing our pipeline of recombinant protein production using contemporary technologies as well as performing individual research projects within the project aims of the group.   Start:  Preferably August 2022 or after agreement   Duration:  Three years   Our research group   We are a small research group at the Finsen Laboratory and we focus on biochemical and biophysical characterization of disease relevant proteins and their ligands. We provide a detailed understanding on how a given pathway maintains homeostasis in normal physiology and why certain aberrations—such a missense mutations and natural polymorphisms—cause dysregulation in pathophysiology. Ultimately, we seek to use this information in translational pipelines -  e.g.  the clinical phase-2 trials with our uPAR-targeting peptide for non-invasive PET imaging of uPAR-expression in chronic inflammation and solid cancer ( Front.
