The position is available from August 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter. The Department of Biology covers biology in a broad sense including ecology, ecotoxicology, bioacoustics, physiology, biodemography, biogeochemistry and earth evolution. We welcome applicants who are prepared to participate in the cross-disciplinary cooperation at the department. The successful applicant is expected to have a research background within climate adaptation (effects, methods, management, aquatic nature based solutions and synergies with climate mitigation, improvement of water quality and biodiversity) and a background within biology, environmental engineering or similar. The applicant will be part of the Ecology group. The position involves teaching responsibilities in climate adaptation as well as supervision at bachelor and master level. Therefore, teaching experience within climate adaptation (effects and methods), GIS, project management or project communication related to climate adaptation will be seen as an advantage. The applicant will also be involved in a variety of tasks related to general university services. The successful applicant will participate in research projects concerning nature-based solutions, nutrient reduction, and climate adaptation/mitigation in the catchment to Odense Fjord as a part of the Odense Fjord Consortia (OFC). OFC is a demonstration setup with Odense Fjord as the demonstration site consisting of all the main players around Odense Fjord (municipalities, utility companies, industries, trade organizations, NGO’s and knowledge institutions). The very ambitious aim of this consortia is to achieve a good ecological condition in Odense Fjord by 2027 plus implementation of climate mitigation aims despite a currently bad condition in the fjord. One challenge is a huge catchment (one third of Funen) discharging water, nutrients and xenobiotics into the fjord plus huge climate related challenges both in the fjord and in the catchment and an impoverished biodiversity. The successful candidate should be willing to complete postgraduate teacher training for assistant professors at SDU if not already achieved and participate in communication to the public – eventually also participate in Citizen Science activities. The successful candidate will be supported with access to a well-developed research infrastructure, laboratory space, shared equipment, and access to modern core facilities, such as imaging and computational facilities, as well as a research climate of lively, open, and critical academic discussion within and across different fields of research and a network among other young excellent scientists.
