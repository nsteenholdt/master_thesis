The bursary entails the enrolment as a PhD student at the PhD school of the Faculty of Theology. The faculty covers the tuition fee (150.000 DKK; 2024) but will not pay a salary for the PhD studies. It is therefore necessary that applicants document their ability to cover their own living costs during their PhD studies. The bursary is thus especially geared at people working part-time for, for instance, the Lutheran Church of Danmark (“Folkekirken”), a non-governmental organization or other public or private employers. The bursary thereby also provides an opportunity for PhD projects across sectors, for instance, for practitioners, supplementary training or continuing education.   Introduction  The PhD program provides PhD students with strong research training which opens a window of opportunity to a variety of careers within the private and public sectors. The program includes the drafting of a PhD thesis, active participation in research networks, PhD courses, teaching, and other forms of knowledge dissemination.   Qualifications  To be considered, applicants must have a master’s degree in theology (120 ECTS or equivalent) or any other relevant master’s degree including African Studies or similar qualifications. Besides attention to the scientific quality and the feasibility of the proposed PhD project, the assessment will put emphasis on the talent for independent research demonstrated by the applicant usually through a master’s thesis or similar.     The qualifications of applicants with non-Danish Master’s degrees will be assessed to ascertain whether they correspond to the Danish level.
