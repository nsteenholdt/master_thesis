The objective of the FRECOM project is to develop novel machine learning based strategies for communication over the nonlinear optical fiber channel. The start date is flexible, but preferably before December 1, 2020. The project is interdisciplinary and will cover topics within the field of machine learning and optical communication. The project will be carried out in Machine Learning in Photonic Systems (M-LiPS), group. The group has a strong track record and industry collaboration in the application of machine learning techniques to optical communication systems and photonic systems in general.  
 
 This Ph.D. project will explore the latest advances within machine learning to enable nonlinear-distortion free communication over the optical fibre channel. It will be explored how to explore machine learning techniques to enable spectrally efficient and robust optical communication systems covering ultra-wide band transmission (O+E+S+C+L band). More specifically, the application and efficient training for auto-encoders will be investigated. The project will cover both algorithm development as well as experimental implementations.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 This PhD position will investigate the research topics below using both theoretical and experimental methods, but not limited to these topics:  Develop novel machine learning based transmitter and receiver schemes  
 Develop novel training algorithms for deep neural networks  
 Investigate the impact of non-ideal transmission schemes on the performance of the algorithms  
 Test the developed algorithms in an experimental test-bed  
 
 
 Candidates must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.  
 
 Candidates are expected to have experience with development of machine learning algorithms and coherent optical communication systems.
