The positions are associated with a recently funded software and data infrastructure project and both are full-time positions for 5 years starting August 1 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter. At the Department of Clinical Medicine, you will be part of what is probably the largest health science research department in Denmark. Our clinical research covers all the medical specialties and takes place in close collaboration with the university hospital and the regional hospitals in the Central Denmark Region. At the department we are approximately 425 academic employees and the same number of PhD students cooperating across disciplines. You can read more about the department  here  and about the faculty  here . SDCA is a center that brings together researchers and clinicians in an aim to better integrate work on multiple aspects of diabetes treatment, research, and education. This project aims to build an open and scalable data infrastructure framework (DIF) for working with, discovering, and managing data that follows FAIR and open science principles. This is a  software  project that focuses on working with data, but not on data itself. A description of the DIF project can be found  here . The DIF project will be contributing to the  research of SDCA  as well as that of other Steno centers and research initiatives throughout Denmark. Since SDCA was started only a few years ago, its technical and social infrastructure are still being actively developed. As a result, all SDCA personnel, including this current position and the rest of the DIF team, have a direct and impactful influence on how the culture and infrastructure is built and developed. Aside from working on the DIF project, other responsibilities for the research software engineer, as well as the rest of the team, include contributing to this (explicit and inclusive) culture, for instance by adding to our  Common Docs . Your job responsibilities As research software engineer you will be: Building and developing RESTful APIs (or APIs in general) for the DIF Reviewing contributed code and documentation text Assisting with or developing tools for improving analysis and workflow pipelines related to using the DIF (e.g. making Python/R packages and scripts) Note , we anticipate that work on the DIF project will not take up all full-time work, so depending on the applicant’s interest, we encourage and support the research software engineer to collaborate on research projects outside of the project time. Team-wide responsibilities The  primary  responsibility for all members of the DIF team will be building and developing the newly started DIF project. For a general overview of timelines and tasks, see the Gantt chart in the project description ( https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dif-project/#deliverables-and-milestones ) More specifically, tasks will include: Refining, critiquing, and improving on the descriptions of the use-cases and the design and architecture of the DIF Finding and reviewing similar projects to identify what to use and what can be improved upon Building, internally testing, and developing each component of the DIF into Minimally Valuable Products for early external testing and refining Writing public-facing,  beginner-friendly , and accessible documentation on contributing to and using the DIF Creating and maintaining websites connected to the DIF (e.g. through GitHub Pages) All team members’  secondary  responsibilities (dependent on time available outside of the DIF project): Contributing to tasks and projects related to the general administration or building up of the general research environment (e.g. writing and/or updating onboarding documentation) Assisting with building up general capacity and skills in reproducibility/transparency of research data analyses Creating and running training sessions related to the DIF and to general computational analysis skills Note , while the team as a whole will need to complete these tasks, any individual member of the team  does not  need to do all these tasks and instead will be assigned specific sections of the project. You will report to Unit Head Annelli Sandbæk. Your competencies We expect, at a minimum, that you: Are proficient in communicating (written and oral) in English Are motivated, interested, and comfortable with working on projects that have recently started and that require contributing to a diverse set of tasks typical of the early stages of any initiative Have demonstrated knowledge of and experience in using either Python or R for general programming tasks (need to be open to learning both) Have developed software packages in Python or R that abides by community-accepted standard practices (e.g. PIP or CRAN) Have used Git or other version control software on a fairly regular basis for projects And we prefer, but don’t require, that you: Have worked on, started, or contributed to open source projects on open sharing and collaborative platforms (e.g. Open Science Framework, GitHub, GitLab) Have knowledge of and familiarity with  general  software development practices Are interested in or motivated to be involved in aspects of building up and developing the culture and infrastructure of a newer organization Have knowledge of and experience in implementing and adhering to FAIR/open principles Have experience in or familiar with using HTML, CSS, and other web technologies.
