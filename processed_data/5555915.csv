The PhD scholarship is part of the collaborative research project, entitled “The implications of large-scale grants for the university as an institutionalized organization” (details available upon request), which is funded by the Carlsberg Foundation’s Young Researcher Fellowship program and led by Associate Professor Jane Bjørn Vedel. The scholarship focuses on how organizations (universities) deal with the consequences of field-level changes related to funding and how these changes affect their organizational form. The PhD candidate will investigate the processes through which large-scale grants impact universities’ organizational form, education and careers, and knowledge production. The candidate should be familiar with organizational theory (e.g., institutional theory and studies in organization and time) and qualitative research, and interested in studying the broader implications of funding on organization(s). Familiarity with Science and Technology Studies (STS) (e.g., the anthropology of knowledge) is considered an asset. The scholarship involves extensive qualitative research in Denmark, and a willingness to reside in the Copenhagen area for the main part of the scholarship.
