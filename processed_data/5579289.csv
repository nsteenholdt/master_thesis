 What your day would look like We’re looking for a software developer with experience in creating and maintaining native applications. You’ll be creating applications such as network tunnel software running on various system platforms such as Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android.  You’ll work with a team of other motivated, talented, and hardworking engineers to design and implement the applications and tools required to take Steinwurf to new levels of success. While our technology is primarily written using C/C++, we also use Go for writing native applications, React/TypeScript for our graphical user interface for both web and native, and Python for tooling and testing. Being part of a focused team means the need for boring meetings is kept to a minimum, and for the most part you’ll be concentrating on developing high-quality work. We have a very loose hierarchy meaning that everybody's opinions are always heard and valued, as we firmly believe that good results are achieved in collaboration. In general, we weigh willingness to learn high, so we seek a passionate software developer who seeks to master their craftsmanship and takes pride in developing well-tested and high-quality code. Also, you will be working at our office located in the NOVI buildings on the Aalborg University campus, where we speak both English and Danish, and where we daily get to enjoy the most amazing food in the canteen. You’ll also be able to work from home but we do expect you to be in the office some days as we believe it’s important to meet in person with the people you work with. Responsibilities 
 
 Creating and maintaining cloud-based applications utilizing Steinwurf's solutions 
 Network configuration for Steinwurf’s software solutions. 
 Develop new Software to showcase the power of erasure correcting codes. 
 Work on new tools to ease the development flow of yourself and your colleagues. 
 
 Job Qualifications

 Experience with front-end technologies such as Typescript, React, HTML5, SASS/LESS, etc. is a plus 
 Knowledge about edge/cloud programming (containers, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.) is a plus.
