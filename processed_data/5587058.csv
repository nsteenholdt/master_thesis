The position is available from 1 September 2022 or later. Title REFOPACK Reshaping of food packaging towards recyclability: the role of bioinspired nanocoatings Research area and project description For a fully circular packaging system and carbon neutrality, plastic production from renewable resources and high level of recycling, remanufacturing and reuse is required. To achieve this, biodegradable polymers have gained considerable attention such as in food and medical packaging. Life Cycle Analyses has demonstrated that mechanical recycling should be preferred followed by biodegradation/composting for biodegradable plastics. However, for recycled biodegradable plastics functional properties and safety must be retained, evaluated and validated. Nanocoatings seem to improve the technological properties of plastics for food packaging, but their impact on recycling and composting process of biodegradable plastics remains to be outlined. Graphene, a very well characterized two dimensional (2D) nanoparticle, will be used as a model system to demonstrate that by fine tuning its properties in polymer-graphene systems. However, the interaction of graphene/polymer coating solution and impact of these coatings on recycling and biodegradation still need to be investigated and understood in-depth fundamental research. The surface properties of 2D nanomaterials plays an important role on its uniform distribution in the polymer matrix. The processing and study of complex microstructure of graphene/polymer multifunctional composite coatings need to be clearly addressed. This PhD project is part of the new research project, REFOPACK, funded by the AUFF Novo and will be carried out in collaboration with Prof. Rafael Auras from School of Packaging, Michigan State University in USA. REFOPACK project will focus on the use of graphene in coating matrix deposited on biodegradable plastic and serve as a proof of concept towards a green transition to zero waste society. We are looking for a highly creative and motivated applicant, who will work on a multidisciplinary project at the intersection of polymer materials and food science. Project description.
