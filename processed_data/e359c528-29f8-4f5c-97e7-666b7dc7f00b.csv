This position is to participate in the Lundbeck Experiment funded project entitled:  Can a dietary strategy reverse neuronal and glial alcohol related dysfunction?   The post doc will conduct electrophysiological (patch clamp recordings), optical, metabolism and behavioral studies at the Dept of Drug Design and Pharmacology at the University of Copenhagen and the Mental Health Centre Copenhagen at Copenhagen University Hospital Frederiksberg-Bispebjerg to elucidate the mechanism of action of medium chain fatty acids in management of alcohol use disorder.

This project will evaluate neural and glial damage induced by exposure to alcohol and determine whether a dietary intervention can reverse this damage, with relevance to alcohol use disorder. Teamwork is a key element of our success, and this project will be carried out in a partnership between 3 laboratories. Inclusivity is central to our approach, and we seek to ensure a balanced project composition in terms of gender, internationalization, and age. We encourage open exchange of ideas and foster a collaborative culture that spans disciplines and national borders.     Your job  As a post doc in this project, your job will be primarily research-based but will also involve teaching within the Department of Drug Design’s bachelor and master’s Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science programs. You will contribute to the development of the department through research of high international quality. In your daily work, you will work closely with colleagues on your project, where you will receive supervision and guidance. Your project will focus on evaluation of the novel hypothesis that medium chain fatty acids (MCTs) alter the excitatory/inhibitory balance in signaling induced by chronic alcohol exposure, which could underlie therapeutic effects seen in those with alcohol use disorder who adhere to the ketogenic diet.   In this proposal, using a mouse model of AUD, you will evaluate in 3 work packages across 3 laboratories: the behavioral effects of MCTs in AUD, whether MCT mediates changes in activity of neurons and astrocytes, and whether changes in metabolism are induced, in order to explore the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of the ketogenic diet in management of AUD. Further, we will explore the intracellular mechanisms that could underlie the alteration.    Your main tasks will consist of     Independent research of high international quality, including publication of research findings   Training students and contributing to teaching activities   Conducting electrophysiology in brain slices   Conducting single photon calcium imaging in brain slices   Conducting optogenetic stimulation of virally transfected brain slices   Conducting metabolic studies in mouse brain slices   Conducting behavioral assays in a mouse model of alcohol use disorder   Collaborating with Danish and international research groups   Contributing to ongoing collaborations with academia    Presentation of research findings at local and international meetings       Profile   We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic scientist with the following competencies and experience:   Essential experience and skills:     You have a PhD in Neuroscience, Pharmaceutical Science or a related field.   You have published a scientific article as first author in a peer reviewed journal.   You can demonstrate that you work well in a team.   You have excellent written and spoken English skills.   You are authorized to work with laboratory animals (i.e., have completed course in Laboratory Animal Science, FELASA accredited). Applicants who do not hold this certification will be required to complete it before starting any in vivo work.       Desirable experience and skills:     You have experience with conducting patch clamp electrophysiology in mouse brain slices.   You have experience with fluorescent microscopy.   You have experience with conducting animal behavioral experiments.   You have experience working in interdisciplinary settings.   You have experience with international collaborations.       Place of employment   The primary place of employment is at the Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology at the University of Copenhagen. As this is a collaborative project conducted across 3 laboratories, some of the work will be done at Bispebjerg Hospital, which is 2.4 kilometers from the Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology.  We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in a dynamic and international research environment. Our research facilities include modern laboratories, run by experienced laboratory managers.     Terms of employment   The average weekly working hours are  37  hours per week.     The position is a fixed-term position limited to a period of  2  years. The starting date is 1 May 2025, or after agreement.
