We are expanding and improving our toolchain and are seeking a Senior Develompent Engineer to make a significant contribution to improvement of existing tools such as HAWC2 which are used both in our internal research and by external clients. In close collaboration with scientific and technical colleagues, you will have a direct impact on developing new generation of tools with a strengthened focus on wind farm modelling through new wake inflow models and tailored farm driver turbine models.  
 
 The position is in the Response, Aero-elasticity, Control and Hydrodynamics (REC) section located at our Risø campus. REC focuses on modelling and analysis of loads and dynamics, aeroelastic stability, and control of both land-based and offshore, including floating, wind turbines and implements its research in software tools and in courses to the benefit of the wind energy community in general. We have high focus on validation against measurements too. This is a highly multi-disciplinary issue involving modelling of the non-stationary inflow field, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, structural stability and control.  
 
 The job 
 
 This position's primary focus is to work closely with researchers and development engineers to provide software development knowledge and best practices and convert prototypes and ideas into efficient codes that benefit the wind energy community. The work involves five main areas of focus:  Further development, testing and support of DTU Wind Energy's core aeroelastic software HAWC2 including interfacing with other tools within DTU Wind's toolchain;  
 Development of HAWC2 ecosystem software including pre- and post-processing tools, scripting tools for supporting use in high performance computing environments, visualization tools and more;  
 Implement and promote software development best practices in teams of software developers and research scientists working in the department.  
 
 
 The successful candidate will be expected to collaborate with other software development staff within the Wind Energy Department, in cross-sectional projects.  
 
 Our expectations of you 
 
 We are primarily using FORTRAN as compiled languages and Python as scripting languages, but we are looking for more skills from a successful applicant. We are seeking candidates that have the following required competences:  Background in Mechanical Engineering, Wind Energy or a physics based application field  
 Good knowledge of the Fortran syntax, the cross platform compilation environment and the numerical math libraries  
 Good knowledge of Python syntax and the scientific Python stack  
 Experience with software design, architecture and larger software projects  
 
 
 In addition, we expect you to have experience in several of the following technologies and scientific fields:  Version control of software (e.g., Git)  
 Build automation, automatic testing and continuous integration tools (e.g., Gitlab CI)  
 Coupling Python with compiled languages (f2py, cython, Pybind11, Boost.Python, SWIG)  
 C++, Matlab, and parallel programming with OpenMP/MPI  
 High performance computing on large-scale linux clusters and job scheduling systems (e.g. Slurm, LSF)  
 Containerization technology, e.g. Docker, Singularity  
 Shell scripting, e.g. Bash, Powershell  
 GUI and visualization (e.g. PyQt, OpenGL)  
 Optimization (OpenMDAO)  
 Databases and lab data protocols  
 Elasticity theory, structural mechanics and multibody dynamics simulations  
 
 
 Finally, we expect that you share our vision to strive for Wind Energy and its successful application in society are comfortably able to  Work independently and to efficiently deliver results on time  
 Work as part of a team in a multi-disciplinary environment  
 Take the initiative, prioritize and work under set deadlines  
 Communicate in English, both verbal and written
