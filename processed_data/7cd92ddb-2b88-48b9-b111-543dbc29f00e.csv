About the Technologies in Practice section  The Technologies in Practice (TiP) section is an interdisciplinary section including fields such as anthropology, sociology, STS, HCI, and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work. It serves as a hub for those working on IT in practice in society, focusing particularly on issues of power, justice, and access. Rather than concentrating on specific topics, TiP will bring together researchers around shared methods and approaches. Its motivation stems from the need to explore the making of digital futures from both a societal and sociotechnical perspective.   Read more about the section on the website  here .   About the Theoretical Computer Science section  The section for Theoretical Computer Science focuses on research in a wide range of areas, including algorithms, algorithm engineering, and algorithmic fairness. It also explores communication protocols, complexity, cryptography, and the impact of cyberwar. The section furthermore conducts research on election security, human-computer interfaces, and information security, as well as large-scale data analysis and multiparty computation.
