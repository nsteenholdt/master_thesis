Then the Department of Ecoscience together with the Greenland Institute for Natural Resources (GINR) invites you to apply for a researcher position. Applications are invited for a four-year research position in the field of ecosystem modelling at the Department of   Ecoscience, Aarhus University, Denmark.   Expected start date and duration of employment This is a four-year position starting 1 October 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The position We advertise a position as researcher within the area of terrestrial ecosystem science with an emphasis on high-latitude ecosystem modeling. We are seeking candidates with a proven experience from work with carbon cycling models combined with handling data on terrestrial trace gas fluxes and energy exchange. Emphasis will be on developing ecosystem models as applied to multiple high latitude sites and bring these into a broader spatial and temporal context. Initially the sites will be those operated under the auspices of the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM) program and data/model comparisons as well as ecological forecasting will be an output component of an EU consortium project GreenFeedBack. Hence experience with models applied to these sites in Greenland is an asset. Writing skills and a strong desire for digesting, synthesizing and communicating observed versus modelled outputs to a broad scientific audience will be essential.   Your qualifications The successful applicant must have obtained a PhD degree in the field of biogeochemistry, physical geography, ecosystem ecology or related disciplines.
