The two PhD fellows shall investigate the role of primary cilia in congenital heart disease comorbidities, including neurodevelopmental defects, and the functional interactions between primary cilia, extracellular vesicles, and endo-lysosomal pathways, respectively, with start 1. September 2025.   Scientific environment    Cilia-AI is a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Doctoral Network (2025-2028), offering 14 PhD positions. The network unites 9 beneficiaries and several partner organisations from both the academic and industrial sectors from seven countries (Denmark, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, and United Kingdom). More information about the network can be found at https://www.cilia-ai.eu.   The objective of Cilia-AI is to train the next generation of interdisciplinary biomedical researchers and entrepreneurs using an array of machine learning approaches to aid in closing the knowledge gaps in ciliary function at molecular, cellular, and organ development level.   Primary cilia are microtubule-based projections found on the surface of nearly every cell in our body. In the last two decades it has become clear that primary cilia have evolved to be key regulatory hubs of the cells, as they concentrate or segregate components of major cellular signalling pathways. Dysfunctional cilia can lead to nearly 40 severe human genetic syndromes (ciliopathies) with highly heterogeneous, overlapping phenotypes, affecting as many as 1 in 400 people. We now know that humans critically depend on cilia to see, hear, smell, breathe, excrete and reproduce. Such activities require a high degree of regulation and critical feedback to ensure robustness in development and homeostasis of different cells, tissues and organs. Understanding this multi-level organisation and regulation in health and disease requires integration of unique multidisciplinary expertise in next-generation technologies such as AI-assisted structural biology, quantitative proteomics, whole exome and long-range whole genome sequencing, single cell- and single nucleus, and spatial transcriptomics. In addition, next-generation imaging technologies such as super-resolution microscopy and cryo-electron tomography in combination with expansion microscopy techniques provide imaging datasets at unprecedented resolution and versatility. All these approaches generate high-content datasets that require deep computational processing to yield meaningful biomedical insights, and it remains a challenge to integrate them across modalities. A key subset of the artificial intelligence field, machine learning, plays a pivotal role in deconvoluting these high-content datasets, integrating diverse multidisciplinary data, and extracting meaningful insights from complex information.   The objective of Cilia-AI is to link genotype to phenotype relationships in the ciliopathies, by understanding variant-function, improve molecular and cellular profiling of disease states and accelerate quantitative high content imaging across scales by leveraging AI-based tools and analyses to identify the molecular and cellular processes involved in cilia biology and its dysfunction in disease.     We will pursue the following specific research objectives: 1. establishing how cilium function is determined by the structure, organisation and variation of ciliary molecules; 2. understanding the cell- and organelle-specific processes in ciliary biogenesis and homeostasis; 3. deciphering the pivotal role of the cilium in regulation of organ development and physiology.    The two specific PhD projects will be within The Cilia Group (co-PI¬¥ed by Prof. S√∏ren Tvorup Christensen and Prof. Lotte Bang Pedersen) in the Section of Cell Biology and Physiology at the Department of Biology. The Cilia Group is recognized worldwide for its pioneering work on primary cilia, employing a variety of different approaches, from biochemistry, molecular biology and proteomics to mammalian cell cultures and zebrafish models, to study the molecular mechanisms by which cilia assemble, disassemble, and function to coordinate cellular signaling networks during development and tissue homeostasis, and how defects in these processes are linked to cancer and developmental disorders, including congenital heart and brain disease (for more information: see  https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/cbp/cilia/ ).   Project descriptions:    Project 1 (DC3): Primary cilia in congenital heart disease comorbidities.  Genetic variants that impair cilia formation and function cause ciliopathies with pleiotropic, overlapping phenotypes including congenital heart (CHD) and neurodevelopmental (NDD) defects. Most patients with CHD survive into adulthood due to significant treatment improvements, although CHD adults have increased mortality and often present with severe comorbidities, including NDD. The association between CHD and NDD is not well understood, but unpublished data from large CHD patient cohorts suggest that a significant part of NDD comorbidity is caused by perturbation of cilia-related genes involved in development of both heart and brain. DC3 will leverage these findings by identifying the gene networks and ciliary functions perturbed by candidate genes involved in both heart and brain development using advanced imaging techniques, spatial resolved transcriptomics and cilia proteomics by proximity labelling in (stem) cell lines and transgenic zebrafish subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-medited gene knock-out. DC3 will pave the way for early diagnosis, support and care for CHD patients with NDD co-morbidities, and provide an opportunity for identification of novel mechanisms involved in development and maturation of both human heart and brain.   Supervisor: Prof. S√∏ren Tvorup Christensen,  stchristensen@bio.ku.dk   Project 2 (DC4): Dissecting the functional interactions between primary cilia, extracellular vesicles, and endo-lysosomal pathways.  DC4 will use cell-based and automatic imaging approaches to investigate, on the one hand, how mutations in specific ciliopathy disease genes affect the subcellular distribution of relevant EV biogenesis/endo-lysosomal regulators (e.g. ALIX, STAM-HRS, TSG101) and, conversely, how depletion of these regulators affects ciliary membrane composition and EV release. Focus will be on kidney epithelial cells and the known ciliary EV cargos such as polycystin-1 and polycystin-2. In addition, to determine the composition of cilia-derived EVs, DC4 will use proximity-labelling approaches to biotinylate specific ciliary EV cargos in cultured kidney epithelial cells, isolate EVs from the culture medium, and use streptavidin pull-down and mass spectrometry to determine the protein content of cilia-derived EVs.

In addition, next-generation imaging technologies such as super-resolution microscopy and cryo-electron tomography in combination with expansion microscopy techniques provide imaging datasets at unprecedented resolution and versatility. All these approaches generate high-content datasets that require deep computational processing to yield meaningful biomedical insights, and it remains a challenge to integrate them across modalities. A key subset of the artificial intelligence field, machine learning, plays a pivotal role in deconvoluting these high-content datasets, integrating diverse multidisciplinary data, and extracting meaningful insights from complex information.   The objective of Cilia-AI is to link genotype to phenotype relationships in the ciliopathies, by understanding variant-function, improve molecular and cellular profiling of disease states and accelerate quantitative high content imaging across scales by leveraging AI-based tools and analyses to identify the molecular and cellular processes involved in cilia biology and its dysfunction in disease.     We will pursue the following specific research objectives: 1. establishing how cilium function is determined by the structure, organisation and variation of ciliary molecules; 2. understanding the cell- and organelle-specific processes in ciliary biogenesis and homeostasis; 3. deciphering the pivotal role of the cilium in regulation of organ development and physiology.    The two specific PhD projects will be within The Cilia Group (co-PI¬¥ed by Prof. S√∏ren Tvorup Christensen and Prof. Lotte Bang Pedersen) in the Section of Cell Biology and Physiology at the Department of Biology. The Cilia Group is recognized worldwide for its pioneering work on primary cilia, employing a variety of different approaches, from biochemistry, molecular biology and proteomics to mammalian cell cultures and zebrafish models, to study the molecular mechanisms by which cilia assemble, disassemble, and function to coordinate cellular signaling networks during development and tissue homeostasis, and how defects in these processes are linked to cancer and developmental disorders, including congenital heart and brain disease (for more information: see  https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/cbp/cilia/ ).   Project descriptions:    Project 1 (DC3): Primary cilia in congenital heart disease comorbidities.  Genetic variants that impair cilia formation and function cause ciliopathies with pleiotropic, overlapping phenotypes including congenital heart (CHD) and neurodevelopmental (NDD) defects. Most patients with CHD survive into adulthood due to significant treatment improvements, although CHD adults have increased mortality and often present with severe comorbidities, including NDD. The association between CHD and NDD is not well understood, but unpublished data from large CHD patient cohorts suggest that a significant part of NDD comorbidity is caused by perturbation of cilia-related genes involved in development of both heart and brain. DC3 will leverage these findings by identifying the gene networks and ciliary functions perturbed by candidate genes involved in both heart and brain development using advanced imaging techniques, spatial resolved transcriptomics and cilia proteomics by proximity labelling in (stem) cell lines and transgenic zebrafish subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-medited gene knock-out. DC3 will pave the way for early diagnosis, support and care for CHD patients with NDD co-morbidities, and provide an opportunity for identification of novel mechanisms involved in development and maturation of both human heart and brain.   Supervisor: Prof. S√∏ren Tvorup Christensen,  stchristensen@bio.ku.dk   Project 2 (DC4): Dissecting the functional interactions between primary cilia, extracellular vesicles, and endo-lysosomal pathways.  DC4 will use cell-based and automatic imaging approaches to investigate, on the one hand, how mutations in specific ciliopathy disease genes affect the subcellular distribution of relevant EV biogenesis/endo-lysosomal regulators (e.g. ALIX, STAM-HRS, TSG101) and, conversely, how depletion of these regulators affects ciliary membrane composition and EV release. Focus will be on kidney epithelial cells and the known ciliary EV cargos such as polycystin-1 and polycystin-2. In addition, to determine the composition of cilia-derived EVs, DC4 will use proximity-labelling approaches to biotinylate specific ciliary EV cargos in cultured kidney epithelial cells, isolate EVs from the culture medium, and use streptavidin pull-down and mass spectrometry to determine the protein content of cilia-derived EVs.
