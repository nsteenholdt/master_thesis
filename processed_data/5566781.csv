The project is part of the research project “Enhancing statistical methodology for toxicophenomics: High-throughput and high-dimensional data for ecotoxicological risk assessment”, which is financed by the Novo Nordic Foundation.   Start date is (expected to be)  October 1st 2022  or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  The main aim of environmental risk assessment is to assign magnitudes and probabilities to adverse effects of human impact. A key parameter used in chemical risk assessment is the benchmark dose, identifying the dose associated with a predefined deviation from non-treated controls in the testsystem investigated. The benchmark dose methodology relies on non-linear dose-response models. The methodology is well-established for univariate data, such as a growth or mortility measured at a single point in time, but less so for more complex data structures such hierarchical data based on repeated experiments or time series, which have the advantage of closer resembling reality and accordingly provide more valuable input  for risk assessments .  In addition, as toxicity is a process in time and exposure concentrations often vary in time (chemicals degrade in the environment, and/or are added repeatedly), statistical methods to describe effect development in time as a function of exposure is becoming increasingly important tools for chemical risk assessment.   The primary focus of the PhD project will be on extending existing dose-response models for univariate data to different types of multivariate data, incorporating the time perspective of toxicity development. The key challenges are 1) developing dose-response models applicable to data from complex hierarchical designs, 2) testing and developing statistical models for toxic effects in time and 3) testing and developing models for dynamic exposure data   The solution to these challenges rely on nonlinear optimization, mixed-effects models, the use of differential equations to incorporate the time aspect and a combination of all. Exploration and validation of the developed methodology to real experimental data and implementation is an important aspect of the project.   Who are we looking for?  We are looking for a candidate with strong competences within the field(s) of statistics and data science. Applicants can have a background in statistics, mathematics, environmental modeling, or environmental toxicology with flair and interest in statistics and data science. The applicant should also be prepared to do some experimental work to produce own data.   Our group and research- and what do we offer?   The successful applicant will be part of a new research group focusing on applied statistics within agronomy, eco-toxicology and phenotyping. We are a part of the crop science section and work closely together with reasearchers across the section, inparticular the plant protection group https://plen.ku.dk/english/research/crop_sciences/pp/. The crop science section studies and teaches basic and applied sciences related to crop production, with a focus on the interaction between Genotype, Management and Environment.  The aim of the crop science section is to improve land management for sustainable food production in a changing climate, by conducting research in laboratories, greenhouses, semi-field and fields. The applied statistics group also works closely together with the environmental toxicology group https://plen.ku.dk/english/research/env_chem_phys/et/. This group focuses on the effects of chemical pollutants on individual organisms, populations and ecosystems. Combined, our research projects are closely connected to national and international plant breeders, the agricultural industry, and Danish and European regulatory authorities concerned with the risk assessment of pesticides and industrial chemicals.     The group is a part of Department of Plant and Environmetal Science, Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. We are located in Taastrup, Copenhagen.   We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in dynamic and international research environment.   Principal supervisor  is   Assistant Professor,  Signe M.
