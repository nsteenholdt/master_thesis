 The Renewable Plants in Energy Systems (RES) section at DTU Wind and Energy Systems is inviting candidates to apply for a PhD in “Enhancing renewable power plants’ performance through advanced control methods”. The research in this section is multidisciplinary and you will enjoy the advantages of a creative and inspiring work environment. You will get the opportunity to participate and influence the development of advanced renewable power plants in collaboration with top universities and industry in the field of wind energy research in Europe and beyond.  
 We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment. We strive for academic excellence in an environment characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom tempered by responsibility. We develop talent by offering national/European and global networking opportunities, unique research infrastructure including a fully controllable MW-scale hybrid power plant at our campus, and a collaborative research environment. 
 Project background 
 
 Future power systems driven by 100% renewable power plants (RPPs) will be extremely complex, uncertain environments with rapidly changing characteristics. The RPPs will be responsible for maintaining security of supply and stability of the power system in absence of conventional generators, coping with simultaneous, e.g. weather, market, and grid uncertainties.   RPPs will provide extensive system services, e.g. frequency reserves, reactive power, voltage control, virtual inertia and black start. One concern is that using traditional linear controllers in RPPs in systems with multiple uncertainties might jeopardize both their own and the system small- and large-signal stability. Thus, the stability of future systems is highly dependent on their own operational conditions, RPPs’ control capabilities, and the interactions between the control layers.  
 In this project, you will develop an advanced control for RPPs providing grid services that is asymptotically stable in the presence of uncertainties. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will play a crucial role in the modeling and control of these RPPs, ensuring optimized performance and efficiency. 
 You will be part of a joint alliance research project called  Advanced control of renewable power plants for resiliency of highly uncertain power systems 
 , where you will interact with researchers and experts from Technical University of Munich (TUM). This requires good communications skills but also allows you to co-operate with leading European research institutes. You are expected to conduct about 6-9 months external research stays at TUM. The strong co-operation between DTU and TUM, while requiring strong collaboration skills, allows you to accomplish the ambitious objectives of the project. 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 During your PhD studies, you will develop advanced control methods for RPPs to ensure their stable grid services, thereby maintaining the security and stability of these complex environments. You are expected to thoroughly model the dynamics of highly uncertain power systems, identify uncertainties, and address interoperability challenges across various control and operational layers within RPPs and the power system. You will carry out theoretical derivations and analyses but also implement simulations to test the developed control methods. 
 As part of your PhD studies, you will publish your work in reputed journals and present it at peer-reviewed scientific conferences. A detailed project plan will be developed with the supervisors within the first two months after enrolment. 
 You will also need to assist in the co-supervision of MSc theses and provide teaching assistance in courses taught at DTU for a limited number of hours.  
 The successful candidate fulfills the following requirements:  
 
 MSc degree in Control and/or Electrical Engineering, or related fields (you must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree) 
 Strong background in both control systems and electrical engineering 
 Basic knowledge of renewable power plants and power converters 
 Experience with technical tools such as PowerFactory and Matlab Simulink  
 Grasp in using artificial intelligence and machine learning in modelling and control applications will be considered an advantage 
 Fluency in communication and reporting in English 
 Creative, proactive and independent thinking 
 
 Prior experience in research in the form of student projects, and capability to work in an interdisciplinary manner are a plus.  
 The successful candidate must also fulfill the requirements for admission to a PhD program at DTU. 
 Approval and Enrolment 
   
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see  DTU's rules for the PhD education 
 .
