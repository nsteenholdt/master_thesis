The National Museum has a tradition of working with Christian Cultural Heritage that stretches back more than 150 years. Based on the study of the rich Danish heritage the successful applicant is expected to establish an interdisciplinary research environment in collaboration with colleagues at the Museum and from other Danish and international research institutions. It is the National Museum’s ambition to establish a new research center focusing on Christian Cultural Heritage Studies in Denmark and abroad, the aim of which is to make significant contributions to research and to develop new ways of disseminating research-based knowledge to the general public.   Job description   The primary task for the Senior Researcher / Research Professor will be to develop and spearhead a large new interdisciplinary research program at the Museum and to make this research relevant to the general public through research dissemination in collaboration with audience initiatives and the department of experience designs. The successful applicant will be a researcher at an internationally competitive level within church history, art history, medieval archaeology etc. with a focus on Northern Europe.   The position is permanent. During the first three years the Senior Researcher / Research Professor will be allocated increased time for research (80%) in order to initiate and obtain external funding for a research center. If the Museum appoints a Senior Researcher to the position, a temporary research professorship with special responsibilities (MSO) or a research professorship with a focus on interdisciplinary research and research dissemination will be posted after a three-year period, provided that a strong, interdisciplinary research environment has been established at that time.

The employment is associated with regular travel activity.     Terms of salary and employment   The working hours are 37 hours a week. Terms of pay and employment are determined in accordance with the collective agreement for academics employed by the Danish state and executive order of 30 October 2015 on the job structure for academic staff with research responsibilities in archives, libraries, museums etc. under the Danish Ministry of Culture.
