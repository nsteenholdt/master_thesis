 The department is organized around eight research units and centers, and we have activities at three campuses in Kolding, Esbjerg, and Sønderborg [ LINK ]. For the open position(s) we are interested in applicants for our European Center for Risk & Resilience Studies [ LINK ] located at Campus Sønderborg. We are expanding the center, and we are proud to announce the opening of a new research pillar within the centre dedicated to advancing the centre mission: “Empowering Actions to Shape Tomorrow's Resilience.” 
 Your new role 
 Our new associate professor(s) will play a pivotal role in developing this new initiative focused on Supply Chain Risk and Resilience Modelling. You will work closely with the existing staff and take a leading role in projects at the intersection of supply chain risk, resilience, quantitative modelling and insurance. We expect your research to aim to understand, predict, and manage risks in complex, global, and interconnected supply chains, which are critical to the stability of modern economies and industries. You will have the opportunity to contribute to high-impact solutions that strengthen supply chain resilience and address the key challenges of the 21st century. 
 We believe that your new role offers the chance to make a meaningful contribution to the future of supply chain risk management, while working in a dynamic and collaborative environment at the forefront of risk and resilience research. 
 Your new department 
 The department’s main teaching activities are related to the bachelor’s programme in Economics and Business Administration (HA) and seven profiles in the master’s programme in Economics and Business Administration (cand.merc). We are currently developing a new profile to be taught in Sønderborg from September 2026. You will be involved in this work, and you will be part of the teaching team. We also run a Graduate Diploma in Business Administration and contribute to several other study programmes at SDU. We highly prioritize engagement and quality in the study programmes and the study environment at our three campuses. 
 The department strongly encourages collaboration between colleagues across the department and the university. The perhaps most obvious possibilities for such collaborations count our own department’s research group on “Supply Chain and Technology Management” [ LINK ] and a forthcoming “Center of Supply Chain Digitalization” situated in Sønderborg at the Faculty of Engineering [ LINK ].  
 Your new colleagues 
 Your colleagues at the department are experienced academics with a broad academic skill set in diverse fields and disciplines.

Moreover, we take pride in didactical innovation and the offering of relevant study programs of the highest quality.
