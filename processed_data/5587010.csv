Expected start date and duration of employment This is a 2–year position from August 2022 or soon thereafter. Job description The project will focus on the use of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for structural characterization of RNA nanostructures and RNA-protein complexes. We are especially interested in studying the dynamic co-transcriptional folding process and will use time-resolved single-particle cryo-EM to do so. Understanding this process will allow us to produce better RNA medicine and express RNA nanostructures in cells. This project is part of the larger COFOLD interdisciplinary research project concerned with understanding co-transcriptional folding ( https://inano.au.dk/about/research-centers-and-projects/cofold ). You will be part of and work together with a research team composed of 4 PIs and 6 Postdocs/PhDs. In this job you will be expected to: Develop our current cryo-EM pipeline for RNA structures towards time-resolved studies of RNA folding. Use our existing RNA design software to develop RNA nanostructures for cryo-EM studies. Use standard molecular biology techniques to clone, sequence, purify and evaluate your RNA. Prepare and optimize cryo-EM grids for time-resolved studies. Collect data at the EMBION cryo-EM facility and use software for structural analysis. Mentor a PhD student and collaborate with other researchers in COFOLD.   Your profile You should hold a PhD in structural biology, molecular biology, nanoscience or similar. You should have a strong interest in RNA structure and folding and the possible applications in RNA medicine and synthetic biology. Previous experiences with RNA bioinformatics, RNA biochemistry and/or biophysical characterization techniques are beneficial. Hands-on experience with cryo-EM and data analysis is preferred, but not a requirement. The candidate should be able to work in an interdisciplinary research environment both independently as well as in close collaboration with coworkers that may come from a different field. Who we are The Andersen Lab for Biomolecular Design ( andersen-lab.dk ) works on design of nano-scale devices using biomolecules as building blocks. Our research aims at understanding the fundamental principles of how biomolecules fold into unique and functional shapes and at using this insight to guide the design of novel nanoscale devices for both basic science and technological applications. Recent work includes development of the RNA origami method ( Geary et al., 2014 ), advanced biosensor devices ( Jepsen et al., 2018 ) and RNA scaffolding of proteins ( Geary et al., 2021 ). We have several papers on cryo-EM of RNA structures in the pipeline for publication. The  Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO) was established in 2002 and at present is a major research and education center based at Aarhus University, Denmark, hosting 60 senior scientists, ~100 postdocs and ~160 PhD students ( www.inano.dk ). The center combines expertise from the disciplines including physics, chemistry, molecular biology and medicine to carry out world class interdisciplinary research in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The center gives access to a broad range of infrastructure, tools and expertise including  EMBION - a state-of-the-art cryo-EM facility ( embion.au.dk ). What we offer  The Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO) offers: a well-developed research infrastructure, laboratories and access to shared equipment. an exciting interdisciplinary environment with many national, international and industrial collaborators. a research climate encouraging lively, open and critical discussion within and across different fields of research. a work environment with close working relationships, networking and social activities. a workplace characterised by professionalism, equality and a healthy work-life balance. Place of work and area of employment   The place of work is the Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO), Gustav Wieds vej 14, 8000 Aarhus C, Aarhus University. Contact information For further information, please contact: Associate Professor, Ebbe S. Andersen, +45 41178619,  esa@inano.au.dk .   Application procedure Shortlisting is used. This means that after the deadline for applications – and with the assistance from the assessment committee chairman, and the appointment committee if necessary, – the head of department selects the candidates to be evaluated. All applicants will be notified whether or not their applications have been sent to an expert assessment committee for evaluation. The selected applicants will be informed about the composition of the committee, and each applicant is given the opportunity to comment on the part of the assessment that concerns him/her self. Once the recruitment process is completed a final letter of rejection is sent to the deselected applicants. Letter of reference If you want a referee to upload a letter of reference on your behalf, please state the referee’s contact information when you submit your application. We strongly recommend that you make an agreement with the person in question before you enter the referee’s contact information, and that you ensure that the referee has enough time to write the letter of reference before the application deadline. Unfortunately, it is not possible to ensure that letters of reference received after the application deadline will be taken into consideration. Formalities and salary range Natural Sciences refers to the  Ministerial Order on the Appointment of Academic Staff at Danish Universities under the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation . The application must be in English and include a curriculum vitae, degree certificate, a complete list of publications, a statement of future research plans and information about research activities, teaching portfolio and verified information on previous teaching experience (if any). Guidelines for applicants can be found  here. Appointment shall be in accordance with the collective labour agreement between the Danish Ministry of Finance and the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. Further information on qualification requirements and job content may be found in the  Memorandum on Job Structure for Academic Staff at Danish Universities .  Salary depends on seniority as agreed between the Danish Ministry of Finance and the Confederation of Professional Associations. Aarhus University’s ambition is to be an attractive and inspiring workplace for all and to foster a culture in which each individual has opportunities to thrive, achieve and develop. We view equality and diversity as assets, and we welcome all applicants. Research activities will be evaluated in relation to actual research time. Thus, we encourage applicants to specify periods of leave without research activities, in order to be able to subtract these periods from the span of the scientific career during the evaluation of scientific productivity.
