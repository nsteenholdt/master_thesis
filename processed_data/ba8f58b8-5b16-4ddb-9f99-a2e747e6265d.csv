This doctoral position is based at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research at University of Copenhagen (UCPH).    The Doctoral Candidate will be supervised by Associate Professor Jonas Thue Treebak. In the Treebak Group, we aim to define mechanisms linking cellular NAD+ to metabolic health. We want to understand the role of the NAD+ generating and consuming pathways for maintaining tissue function and adaptability in response to metabolic stress. We employ innovative preclinical models to manipulate NAD-related metabolites cell type-specifically and determine functional implications. We have developed several novel and unique experimental models and techniques related to in vivo animal research.    We have preliminary data from quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of skeletal muscle that show key proteins in the insulin signalling cascade are ADP-ribosylated. Since ADP ribosylation (ADPr) is mediated by NAD+-consuming ADP-ribosyltransferases, this indicates a yet unrecognized interplay between insulin signalling and cellular NAD+ metabolism. Our hypothesis is that ADPr plays an essential role to regulate insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, and our over-arching aim is to determine the role of this posttranslational modification (PTM) for maintaining cellular glucose homeostasis and insulin action. Your tasks would be to define and compare insulin-induced ADP ribosylomes of insulin sensitive and resistant skeletal muscle, and to identify key modifications that are important for insulin signalling to mediate glucose disposal. We strive to understand the molecular basis for ADPr in skeletal muscle insulin resistance, and we are looking for candidates who are motivated to integrate data available from high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics analyses with approaches in in vivo physiology and molecular biology.    We are highly motivated and self-driven with a passion for metabolic research.

About the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research  The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR) is an academic research Center that pioneers groundbreaking research towards better cardiometabolic health. Through collaborative interdisciplinary research from single-cell genomics to whole-body systems, CBMR aims to transform the basic understanding of cardiometabolic health and accelerate its translation into prevention and treatment strategies. The Center’s uniquely multi- and interdisciplinary approach combines research in genetics, physiology and pharma¬cology, to better understand the complex interplay of the many factors that drive cardiometabolic disease. You can learn more in the  Executive Summary of CBMR's Strategy 2024–2028 . CBMR was established in 2010 and has been in the Maersk Tower at the Panum building since 2017. Around 260 employees create an international, highly collaborative research environment across disciplines.    Job description  Your key tasks as a PhD fellow at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, UCPH are to:     Carrying through an independent research project under supervision.   Completing PhD courses or other equivalent education corresponding to approximately 30 ECTS points.   Active participation in research environments including a stay at another research team.   Obtaining experience with teaching or other types of dissemination related to your PhD project.   Teaching and disseminating your knowledge.    Writing a PhD thesis based on the results of your project     Required qualifications  As an applicant you must have:     Qualifications corresponding to a master’s degree related to the subject area of the project. Please note that your master’s degree must be equivalent to a Danish master’s degree (i.e., corresponding to 120 ECTS).   Fluency in English and excellent communication skills.   A curious mindset with a strong interest in skeletal muscle metabolism, in vivo physiology, and bioinformatics.   Basic knowledge about LC-MS/MS-based proteomics, sample preparation and MS data processing is an advantage.    Team player with strong interpersonal and communication skills.     Applicants will also be required to meet the European Commission’s MSCA Doctoral Network eligibility criteria, notably:     Mobility Rule - Applicants can be of any nationality and must not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in Denmark for more than 12 months in the 36 months immediately before the start of their employment at UCPH. Compulsory national service, short stays such as holidays, and time spent as part of a procedure for obtaining refugee status under the Geneva Convention are not considered.   Doctoral Candidate requirement – the applicant must not be in possession of a doctoral degree at the first day of the employment. Researchers who have successfully defended their doctoral thesis but who have not yet been awarded the doctoral degree are not eligible.     Please note that you will only be considered for the position if you fulfil both above eligibility criteria.   Key criteria for the assessment of applicants     Professional qualifications relevant to the PhD project   Relevant work experience   Publications   The grade point average achieved   Other professional activities   Language skills   The successful applicant is also required to be enterprising and to possess good   interpersonal skills     Place of employment  The place of employment is at Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in a dynamic and international research environment.    Terms of employment  The employment as PhD fellow is full time and limited to a period of 3 years. The start date is September 1, 2025, or after agreement.   The employment is conditioned upon the applicant’s successful enrolment as a PhD student at the Graduate School of Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. This requires submission and acceptance of an application for the specific project to the Graduate School of Health and Medical Sciences.   The PhD study must be completed in accordance with The Ministerial Order on the PhD programme (2013) and the faculty’s rules on achieving the degree.   Salary, pension and terms of employment are in accordance with the requirements from the European Commission related to the MSCA programme and the agreement between the Ministry of Taxation and The Danish Confederation of Professional Associations on Academics in the State. Depending on seniority, the monthly salary starts at approximately 30,700 DKK/roughly 4,100 EUR (April 2024 level) plus pension.   The EU MSCA grant consists of a monthly living allowance of EUR DKK 4,488 (approx. DKK 33,400), and a monthly mobility allowance of EUR 600 (approx. DKK 4,470). In addition, a family allowance of EUR 495 (approx. DKK 3,690) may apply if eligibility conditions are fulfilled.
