 Innoflow is a SaaS scale-up helping companies achieve diverse, inclusive, and high performing workplaces by enabling anonymous case-based assessment across the entire employee life cycle. Innoflow allows HR and Talent Acquisition to unbiasedly attract, acquire and develop talent based on each company’s current business challenges. That way, we help organisations achieve DE&I targets and find the right match for both candidates and companies. We believe that this is one way of creating the world that we dream of! By minimising the risk of conscious and unconscious bias, everyone with the right competencies gets the opportunity to show them off. 
 To achieve that, we need our software offerings to be fine-tuned, well designed and easy to use. On a daily basis, you will be working closely with our Head of Technology & Engineering. The prospect of translating vision, mission, and business strategy into a product vision and a more short-term product roadmap should sound appealing and challenging to you. 
 To become our new Head of Product, we will ask you to submit an anonymised, case-application. Working with the case will allow you to familiarise yourself with some of the tasks and challenges that you will face on the job. 
 What will I be doing? 
 You will be responsible for aligning our product strategy with our business strategy. We will quickly introduce to you our portfolio of products, one of which is the product you are about to engage with when solving the case. 
 Innoflow is not a consulting company, we are a technology company. That is important to you because our design activities must then focus on scalability and automation of customer user flows, as well as focus on frictionless candidate user flows. With multiple-use cases and a stuffed product roadmap, you’ll have your hands full from day one! 
 You will have plenty of tasks and responsibilities. Therefore, it is important that you are a person who finds paths where others get lost. You feel comfortable diving into the daily activities without losing track of the long-term expectations and strategy. To that end, creating results through your team of UI/UX Designers should not only be something you’re capable of, but rather something you’ll enjoy. 
 You are a competent communicator who can cooperate with multiple stakeholders. You will receive insights from our Customer Success and Sales Team with requests and business requirements. Your job is to prioritise the activities and ensure a good flow of continuous improvements to our products, aligned with the product vision and the overall strategy. 
 You will work alongside a remote tech team consisting of our Head of Technology and Engineering, two backend developers, a frontend developer, and a QA Engineer. Thus, collaborating and coordinating across nationalities, workspaces and languages should be intriguing. In Copenhagen, your team will, to begin with, consist of a full-time UI/UX Designer and a student assistant. We have global ambitions and will be scaling the organisation going forward. You will be included in the process of designing the right team. 
 It is not crucial of you to have specific educational qualifications, X years of experience, or if you prefer to wear mis-matched socks to work every day. If you think that you’ve got the skills to succeed in the job, we encourage you to apply. 
 However, we believe a UX background is essential, ideally combined with front-end development experience. 
 Before you rush on and check out the case, we would like to tell you a bit more about us and what you can expect. 
 What can you expect? 
 You can expect a team that is well-invested in the engagement and well-being of every employee. We value personal differences and have ongoing conversations to ensure everyone finds their tasks meaningful. 
 Innoflow is currently a team of 20+ team members of various nationalities, the majority working from our office in Copenhagen, close to Christianshavn Metro. Your primary place of work will be at the office. However, you will havethe flexibility to work from elsewhere and outside of regular business hours if you wish to do so. 
 At the office, we eat lunch together every day, enjoy a good cup of coffee, engage in the occasional game of table tennis, and take a healthy break together every afternoon from 13:50-14:00. 
 Our remote tech team and a few other remote workers are not placed in Copenhagen or Denmark but are invited to our Summer and Christmas Parties. 
 Everyone is responsible for each other’s well-being. Therefore, we have a Culture C-Suite, where everyone has chosen what their unique contribution to the Innoflow-culture should be. For instance, we have a Chief Celebration Officer, who is responsible for festive events and a Chief Sports Officer, who tries to create a bit of friendly competition around the office. And don’t worry, if you aren’t into sports, you can find some comfort with our Chief Drinks Officer. We’re curious to see what your C-Title will be! 
 The practicalities 
 
 The job is a full-time position ideally starting in May 2022. 
 There is free lunch, fruit, snacks, as well as tea and coffee. 
 The address for our office is Bådsmandsstræde 19B, 1415 KBH K. 
 You need to be able to read and write in English on a professional level. 
 
 About the recruitment process 
 To apply for the position, you must solve a relevant case. All applicants will receive feedback on their case application.
