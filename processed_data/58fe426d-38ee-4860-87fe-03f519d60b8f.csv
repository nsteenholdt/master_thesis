We're seeking an enthusiastic Sales Operation Specialist to join our growing team and help steer our international bookings towards new horizons! 
 About the position 
 Our Sales Operation team is responsible for managing group reservations on our passenger ships. We cater to both business and private groups from the Nordic countries and around the world, who book directly or through travel agents. 
 You'll be based in our Copenhagen office, working within a global team that oversees the 'back office household' of our international bookings. There's also the possibility to work from our Oslo office. 
 Your key responsibilities 
 As our Sales Operation Specialist, your tasks will include: 
 
 Managing group reservations and handling inquiries for Business Groups, Private Groups, and International/Regional Groups 
 Efficiently handling back-office tasks such as allocation adjustments, manifest entries, payments, and finalizing bookings 
 Supporting the delivery of our promises to customers 
 Embracing our 'One Team' mindset to assist with wider tasks during high-volume periods (we call this Total Sales) 
 Participating in ship meetings, vessel tours, and key agent review meetings as appropriate 
 Providing guidance and support to customers during TIP (Travel Interruption Protection) situations 
 
 What's in your suitcase? 
 We're looking for a passionate individual with a drive to learn and develop. While your educational background is less important, experience in the travel industry (e.g., Tour Operator, Hotel, or Tourist industry) is beneficial. We expect you to have:

 Keen attention to detail and a structured approach to work 
 Excellent organizational skills and the ability to deliver first-class customer service 
 Capability to work in a global, cross-functional environment

 A role in a growing team with immense potential 
 The chance to influence our culture and work processes 
 A varied workday with challenges and development opportunities 
 Attractive benefits, including pension, canteen, and fitness arrangements 
 Opportunities to experience our ships through employee travel 
 A dynamic workplace with engaged colleagues and a sea view from the office
