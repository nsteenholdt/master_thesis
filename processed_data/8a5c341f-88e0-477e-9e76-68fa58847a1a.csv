This opportunity offers a chance to work at the forefront of neurodegenerative research, focusing on developing cutting-edge technologies to uncover the mechanisms of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) pathology.   About the project:    The position focuses on further developing the  Seeding Amplification Assay   (SAA)  to establish seeding profiles of protein fibrils extracted from human brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, the project investigates Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), two disorders α-syn aggregation driven disorders with distinct clinical trajectories. While PD progresses slowly, MSA leads to death within 5-6 years. The presence of distinct α-syn strains in PD and MSA may underlie differences in disease progression, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. By advancing the SAA, this project aims to map region-specific α-syn seeding behaviours and link them to proteomics networks, elucidating molecular factors driving these devastating conditions.   Our research group:   The Centre for Stereology and Neuroscience, comprising 15 staff and students, provides a collaborative and interdisciplinary environment.  Our research spans cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying movements disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s Disease and atypical parkinsonism disorders) and brain conditions such as schizophrenia and dementia.    We analyse post-mortem brain tissue using stereology-based techniques and molecular biology, complemented by in vivo and in vitro models.  With access to an extensive brain collection, we collaborate closely with clinicians at Bispebjerg Hospital, and participate in the  Copenhagen Centre for Translational Research , a cross-disciplinary research hub.    Learn more about us:  Centre for Stereology and Neuroscience .   Key responsibilities:     Develop and implement workflows for high-throughput α-syn seeding assays using fibrils purified from human post-mortem brain tissue.   Combine experimental data with machine learning models to predict aggregation kinetics and molecular interactions.   Analyse and interpret results to identify brain-region-specific α-syn strain behaviours and their associated proteomic networks.   Collaborate with interdisciplinary teams locally and internationally.   Publish findings in high-quality peer-reviewed journals and present research at scientific conferences.     Required qualifications:      PhD or equivalent  in biotechnology, biochemistry, biophysics or related fields.   Proven expertise in: 	   Protein purification and quantification assays.   Fluorescence-based cellular workflows.   Data analysis using tools such as R, Python, and/or MATLAB.            Excellent communication skills and ability to work collaboratively in a team.   Adaptability, collaboration skills, and enthusiasm for multidisciplinary research.        Proficiency in written and spoken English.     Preferred   qualifications :     Experience in  proteomics  and bioinformatics/computational modelling.        A strong publication record in peer-reviewed journals.     What we offer:     A dynamic and collaborative research environment with a strong translational focus, providing opportunities to shape and advance your research interests.    Opportunities to visit collaborators in the USA for short-term research exchanges.   Mentorship and support for career development, including training in grant applications and opportunities to mentor and supervise students.   The chance to contribute to high-impact translational studies, potentially driving clinical advances in neurodegenerative disease treatments.      Expectations:     Contribute to the development of the SAA in the lab and establish new experimental workflows for brain tissue.   Actively participate in collaborative research efforts and lab-wide activities.   Disseminate findings through publications, conferences, and outreach initiatives.
