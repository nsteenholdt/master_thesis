 Innoflow is a SaaS scale-up helping companies achieve diverse, inclusive, and high performing workplaces by enabling anonymous case-based assessment across the entire employee life cycle. Innoflow allows HR and Talent Acquisition to unbiasedly attract, acquire and develop talent based on each company’s current business challenges. That way, we help organisations achieve DE&I targets and find the right match for both candidates and companies. We believe that this is one way of creating the world that we dream of! By minimising the risk of conscious and unconscious bias, everyone with the right competencies gets the opportunity to show them off. 
 To achieve that, we need a marketing manager to strategise, plan, and execute our paid and organic marketing campaigns. While it’s important that you enjoy being operational and executing daily tasks, it is equally important that you find interest in leading, developing, and creating results through a team. In short, we want you to take the reins on our marketing activities. 
 To become our new Marketing Manager, we will ask you to submit an anonymised, case-application. Working with the case will allow you to familiarise yourself with some of the tasks and challenges that you will face on the job. 
 What will I be doing? 
 You will be responsible for our organic and paid marketing strategies. You will report to our CCO, working very closely to ensure that our sales activities align with our marketing activities. 
 You should focus on building an effective inbound marketing funnel programme that drives leads through the funnel to Sales. Your marketing programme should be based on marketing automation and best practice marketing programs, tracking and reporting to continually analyse and improve results.

 Furthermore, you will ensure that our brand communication is consistent with our brand strategy across allmarketing and sales activities like website, e-mail campaigns, SoMe, content marketing and sales pitches. In addition, you will work with our Product team on creating content that shows enhanced product value and benefits. 
 You will be leading a team of one full-time Marketing Specialist, three part-time marketing employees, and two copywriters - all focused on helping with organic content, web design, paid advertising, and SEO. Furthermore, Dentsu is pro bono helping us with our marketing activities and your team will have interns twice a year. It is therefore important to us that you enjoy being in a role where you share your expertise and develop the students by giving them responsibility and trust. As we are scaling, your team and leadership responsibility will grow. 
 We believe a background in paid marketing is essential but are not too concerned with your past experiences. 
 Before you rush on and check out the case, we would like to tell you a bit more about us and what you can expect. 
 What can you expect? 
 You can expect a team that is well-invested in the engagement and well-being of every employee. We value personaldifferences and have ongoing conversations to ensure everyone finds their tasks meaningful.

 At the office, we eat lunch together every day, enjoy a good cup of coffee, engage in the occasional game of table tennis, and take a healthy break together every afternoon from 13:50-14:00. 
 Our remote tech team and a few other remote workers are not placed in Copenhagen or Denmark but are invited to our Summer and Christmas Parties. 
 Everyone is responsible for each other’s well-being. Therefore, we have a Culture C-Suite, where everyone has chosen what their unique contribution to the Innoflow-culture should be. For instance, we have a Chief Celebration Officer, who is responsible for festive events and a Chief Sports Officer, who tries to create a bit of friendly competition around the office. And don’t worry, if you aren’t into sports, you can find some comfort with our Chief Drinks Officer. We’re curious to see what your C-Title will be!
