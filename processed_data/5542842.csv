 About the job As a .NET Developer in HiFi Klubben, you get freedom and responsibilities right away. You will be developing features and integrations for our demanding and specialized digital commerce solution. In this job, you will have the best of both worlds: Commercially and technically skilled colleagues in HiFi Klubben’s omnichannel team – and some of the more experienced .NET developers in Denmark as your day-to-day peers and colleagues via our partner. 
 Our omnichannel team consists of avid e-commerce profiles who think digital commerce from dusk till dawn. They design and plan the best possible user experience, describe new, interesting features and scope advanced integrations to other systems. You will help them succeed. 
 On the development side, you will work as an integrated part of our distributed team of developers sitting in Aarhus, Copenhagen and even Portugal. You will work with the latest technologies, and you will have the opportunity to dig into our solution and immerse yourself in its technologies and architecture. 
 Your profile You have at least two years of experience in development in .NET and .Net Core - and you have experience from other projects that might have a scent of digital commerce. You don’t need to have 10 years of seniority and several projects in your belt, but we expect a high level of professional pride, where you constantly seek to improve the quality of your own and others' work. The important part for us, is that you actively take responsibility for your own development tasks – while still paying attention to the overall architecture

Frontend is a single-page application based on React and SCSS. Everything is Azure based on microservices, app services and functions with CloudFlare CDN in front. We use Jira, Octopus-deploy, Git etc. In other words, we have plenty of buzzwords. 
 As .NET Developer, we also expect you to… 
 
 Know about SCRUM processes and that you are used to working agile. 
 Have experience in developing micro-services and microservice oriented architecture. 
 Know your way around Azure which we use for our entire environment. 
 Have experience with relational databases and in developing websites with a lot of integrations. 
 Be focused on details and take pride in performing a task on time and in good quality 
 
 We offer: 
 
 Salary according to your qualifications, seniority and experience. 
 A challenging job in an informal environment where you will find a short distance from idea to action. 
 Strong professional sparring and the opportunity for personal development in an award-winning omnichannel team with many years of e-commerce experience. 
 The possibility to work close to some of the best .NET developers in Denmark via our partner setup. 
 Possibility to work both from home and from our offices in Lystrup.
