The basic idea of the ERC Consolidator Grant is to use established methods and models of mortality research and apply those to capture and model fertility patterns, systematically establishing shared regularities between birth and death patterns. The emerging framework is envisioned as a common language and tool to allow bridging disciplines and understand principle causes and consequences of age-trajectories of birth and death.   The Centre is one of the leading teams in the world for demographic mortality modelling and forecasting. One of the prime directions of the Centre’s research is ageing in modern societies and its diverse implications. We study patterns of changing mortality and morbidity, mostly in human populations but also in non-human species. We maintain a strong and unique profile in analytical demography and are expanding to also include more application-oriented research like pension schemes or covid-19 demography. The Centre is part of the Faculty of Business and Social Sciences and collaborates with researchers in economics and political science, as well as researchers in other fields including evolutionary ecology, conservation biology, mathematics and data analysis in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, epidemiology, biostatistics, biodemography and health economics in the Faculty of Health Sciences, and literature and media science in the Faculty of Humanities. Across the disciplines, the Centre is now expanding towards fertility research.  Job description  Candidates should have background in fertility research, knowledge of or strong interest in formal demographic methods, experience with statistical analysis and preferably experience in working with human fertility data. You are a quantitatively minded researcher working with population data, and holding a Ph.D. in demography, economics, actuarial science, public health, epidemiology, statistics, or a related field. You would be excited about innovating formal demographic methods for fertility research. You thrive in interdisciplinary collaborations, and you can coordinate joint work in such groups. Fluency in programming (e.g. R) to conduct research is desirable. Working Language is English.  More information For further information please contact Annette Baudisch, phone +45 6550 9355, email  baudisch@biology.sdu.dk . Appointment to the position requires a PhD or equivalent and will be in accordance with the salary agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. Research will be predominant in the position. Teaching assignments can be agreed individually. Furthermore, other types of assignments may occur to a limited degree. The University determines the distribution of the various assignments. The weighting of the different assignments may vary over time. Upgrading of pedagogical qualifications is not a part of this position. Employment as Postdoc alone will thus not qualify to appointment as Associate Professor/Senior Researcher. Assessment A panel will assess the qualification of the candidate for the described post based on the submitted material, which should include (as .pdf or .docx files): 
 
 A motivation letter 
 A detailed CV 
 Degree certificates (inclusive of Ph.D.-diploma) or provisional documentation hereof 
 A complete and numbered list of publications 
 Two to three scientific peer-reviewed publications considered by the applicant to be the most important for this position. If the publication has been co-authored, co-author statements must be a part of this pdf 
 Please also attach the PhD dissertation as a publication, if such exist. Please note that one .pdf file must be attached for each publication
