 The point of departure for the project “Rural Digital Care: Strengthening the inclusion of older people in digital care services in rural municipalities (RuDiCare)” is the ongoing digitalization of care services in Denmark, including in municipal home care. While this development can be expected to have significant potential benefits in rural areas, a large part of the population at risk of digital exclusion resides here. RuDiCare aims to identify how digital care services can become more inclusive through focusing on its implementation and relational aspects between care providers, older citizens, and technology.  
 The planned starting date for this position is 1 April 2025, or as early as possible thereafter. 
 The project 
 The postdoc will be responsible for the independent execution of research tasks related to subproject 2 focusing on changing demands towards care recipients to become more active, which can lead to digital exclusion. The postdoc will, thus, explore emerging forms of active user engagement and address the role of technology, structural issues, and organizational implementation to identify pathways that enable inclusive user involvement. The postdoc will apply a range of qualitative methods (mainly observations of digital care interactions and in-depth interviews with older care recipients). Here, the postdoc will work closely together with PI Barbara Fersch, who is responsible for subproject 1 (emerging trust relations in digitalized care). To ensure that the perspective of older citizens is adequately considered in all phases of RuDiCare, a user panel will be established in the start of the project. Designing and starting this user panel (consisting of older citizens) will also be part of the postdoc’s responsibilities.  
 Selection criteria 
 To qualify for the position, you need to have a completed (or close to completion) PhD in Social Sciences (for example within Sociology, Anthropology or Public Health and related disciplines). 
 An ideal candidate will have the following profile: 
 
 Strong qualitative research skills 
 Experience with qualitative interviews and participant observation 
 Experience with participative methods such as user panels is not a requirement, but will be a strong advantage 
 Interest in questions of digital exclusion and inclusion in relation to care in rural areas, including conceptual development in this field 
 Documented potential to publish in peer-reviewed journals at an internationally recognized level 
 A clear interest and drive to work together with the PI to further strengthen this new research focus at the Danish Center for Rural Research at SDU 
 Proficiency in Danish and English 
 
 As a postdoc, you will become a member of the Danish Center for Rural Research, which is part of the  Department of Political Science and Public Management  and is based at SDU Esbjerg. As the research will take place in a municipality on Funen, a considerable part of work activities can be expected to take place here. The Center is characterized by a social science perspective on rural issues and has  adopted inequality in health and access to public services as a  strategic focus area  for the coming years. This includes the field of digital inclusion. As a postdoc you will have the opportunity to shape and develop this research agenda together with the PI.  
 The Department of Political Science and Public Management believes in fostering a stimulating and inspiring environment for both faculty members and students. The department's ambition is therefore to recruit, develop, and retain talented scholars committed to both academic excellence and departmental development. Furthermore, the department wishes our staff to reflect the diversity of society and thus welcomes applications from all qualified candidates regardless of personal background.
