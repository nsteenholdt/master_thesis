The  Pioneer Centre for Artificial Intelligence   is a multi-university research centre led by Professor Serge Belongie. Interdisciplinary and at the forefront of fundamental AI research, the centre focuses on fundamental AI research, and within an interdisciplinary framework, develops platforms, methods, and practices addressing society’s greatest challenges.   We invite applicants who want to contribute to the IT University’s vision of creating and sharing knowledge that is profound and leads to groundbreaking information technology and services for the benefit of humanity; and to contribute to the Digital Design Department's research themes on care, creativity, participation, data and AI.   The projects   1)   Exploring human visual perception through deep learning of EEG signals and Eye Tracking:  Can we build a computational model of the brain? What can such an effort tell us about the human mind? Would such a model be a true example of artificial intelligence? These are some of the questions that have motivated many AI researchers in creating machines that can mimic natural intelligence. With this PhD project, we would like to develop the foundations of a long term effort in attempting to answer the first questions, starting with human visual perception. The successful candidate will investigate how to build interpretable deep learning models of visual perception with the long-term goal of establishing deep neural networks as a tool to interpret the human brain. In particular,  given the mediating role of eye movements in the visual perception process, we will work on building models that leverage both EEG and eye-tracking using neural network architectures that can process spatio-temporal data, so that we can capture both topological and sequential patterns in the brain response.   Principal supervisor:  Associate Professor Paolo Burelli, Department of Digital Design,  pabu@itu.dk   2) The replicability crisis in XR research:  Extended reality (XR) research continues to produce breakthroughs in interaction techniques, discover remarkable behavioral effects of acting with virtual bodies and environments, and demonstrate its ability to move traditional laboratory experiments online. As in other sciences, questions about replicability and robustness of empirical findings are increasingly being raised. Although XR as a technological medium is exceptionally well suited for cross-lab replications, initiatives that are being implemented in other behavioral sciences, such as open source, open data, preregistration, multi-site studies, adversarial collaboration, and many others, are rarely used in XR research. The present PhD project will systematically explore the extent of the replicability crisis in XR research. The project will establish the applicability of initiatives that have improved scientific practice in other research areas, for XR research. As a result, the project will lead an international open science initiative to make both previous and future XR research more robust.   Principal Supervisor : Assistant Professor, Aske Mottelson, Department of Digital Design,  asmo@itu.dk . Co-supervisor: Professor Kasper Hornbæk, Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen.   Who are we looking for?   We are looking for candidates within the field(s) of human-computer interaction, computer science, computational neuroscience. Applicants can have a background from other sciences, with a strong computational skills background. We are interested in students who are interested in solving fundamental questions, working within an interdisciplinary framework, and who are curious about how AI is contributing to solving some of society’s most pressing issues.   Our group and research - and what do we offer?   These PhD stipends are funded or co-funded by the Pioneer Centre for Artificial Intelligence’s collaboratories: Extended Reality, Fine-grained Analysis, Networks & Graphs, and Causality & Explainability. The Pioneer Centre for AI is located at the University of Copenhagen, with partners at Aarhus University, Aalborg University, Technical University of Denmark, and the IT University of Copenhagen. There will be a cohort of PhD students starting during the fall of 2022 across the partner universities, who will interact with students “belonging” both in the research sections and at the Pioneer Centre for AI.   PhD students at the Pioneer Centre for AI will have extraordinary access to computing resources, international researchers across many disciplines within computer sciences and other academic areas, as well as courses and events at the centre, and meaningful collaboration with industry, the public sector, and the start-up ecosystem.
