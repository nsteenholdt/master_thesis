The position is offered within the lab of Robin Andersson.   Project description  Large-scale genetic association studies (GWAS) have succeeded in identifying hundreds of thousands of associations between genetic loci and diseases and traits in humans. The next grand challenge — linking disease genetics to disease biology — has yet to be solved. Most GWAS associations involve non-coding variants that lie within gene regulatory elements — enhancers or promoters. However, a lack of precise tools for the accurate assessment of regulatory activities, especially for heterogeneous cell populations, has prevented progress in connecting genetic variants to their impacted gene regulatory processes. To address this challenge, we are 1) developing new assays and 2) computational frameworks to resolve gene regulatory activities in single cells and 3) apply these to map regulatory activities across cell types to investigate the mechanisms and cell-type specific effects of genetic variants. We are seeking a postdoc to join this effort, focusing on developing computational and statistical methods to model enhancer activity, enhancer-gene regulation, and cellular heterogeneity based on single cell data. Specific focus will be to integrate transcription initiation data into modeling of gene regulation and develop frameworks for enhancer-guided variant-to-function analysis.   Description of the scientific environment  The lab of Robin Andersson focuses on modeling gene regulation with the aim to gain insights into molecular mechanisms by which enhancer or promoter dysregulation contributes to disease risk. We take an interdisciplinary approach and combine machine learning, statistical learning, genetics, and molecular biology to: (1) determine which noncoding sequences act as enhancers, which genes they regulate, and in which cell types they are active; (2) learn how the human genome encodes regulatory activity; and (3) predict the impact of regulatory genetic variants. For more information, see  https://anderssonlab.org/ .   The Andersson lab is a part of Department of Biology, Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. The group is based in a highly collaborative environment in the Section for Computational and RNA Biology, which is currently composed of 13 strong research groups. We are also affiliated with the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomics Mechanisms of Disease ( https://www.broadinstitute.org/nnfc ) at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.   We are located at the Biocenter in central Copenhagen, Denmark. Due to its close proximity to the Biotech Research & Innovation Centre (BRIC) as well as the Faculty of Health and Medical Science, collaborations across disciplines, groups and institutes are a natural part of the efforts in the lab. We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in a dynamic and international research environment. Our research facilities include modern laboratories and computational infrastructures.   Further information on the Department is linked at  http://www.science.ku.dk/english/about-the-faculty/organisation/ . Inquiries about the position can be made to Associate Professor   Robin Andersson ,  Department of Biology,  robin@bio.ku.dk .   Formal requirements  We are seeking a genuinely motivated individual with a PhD in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, or a comparable field with extensive experience in the analyses of high-throughput single-cell sequencing data. Theoretical understanding in statistical modelling and practical experiences in the analyses of single-cell sequencing data are expected from the applicant. Importantly, the applicant should have a strong interest in gene regulation and variant-to-function analysis, and a desire to work on an interdisciplinary and highly collaborative project bridging single-cell genomics and genetics. Continuous scientific discussions and a strong dedication for ongoing research questions within the group also require proactive participation and enthusiasm for problem solving.   In particular, we are looking for candidates with the following background:     A PhD in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, or a related discipline   Extensive post-graduate experience in genomics analyses and computational analyses of high-throughput single-cell sequencing data   Strong programming and data analytical skills   A high proficiency in spoken and written English     Terms of employment   Duration is for 36 months.
