We are committed to producing outstanding research with the highest academic and social impact and to offer excellent research conditions. The division hosts a dynamic community of PhD students. 
 
 We are looking for a talented and motivated applicant who wants to gain hands-on experience in cutting-edge energy modeling and analysis and impact the green transition while working alongside a dedicated team that values collaboration and mentorship. We offer the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research on the value of developing and using energy system modeling tools, including economic, technical and environmental aspects, as a basis to assess the role of ports as energy hubs in a green transition. 
 
 The Ports as Energy Transition Hubs (POTENT) Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Doctoral Network is looking for 15 qualified PhD candidates interested in the field of Energy Infrastructure, Maritime Economics, Ports, and Data Science (see short descriptions of other positions below). The primary objective of the POTENT Network, led by Copenhagen Business School, is to investigate how ports can support and accelerate the clean energy transition in Europe. The research will focus on: 
 Identifying gaps in renewable energy, green fuel infrastructure, and technologies to address these gaps, especially integration of digital technologies to optimize energy use, improve efficiency, and integrate renewables. 
 Considering the systemic aspects of integrated energy ports, including the implications of integrating ports into electricity grids, and the socioeconomic and regulatory aspects of port development. 
 Investigating the governance and business model challenges and opportunities that ports face in the energy transition and exploring how they can create and capture value, manage stakeholder relationships, and make decisions that align with the energy transition goals. 
 
 This research project provides a fantastic opportunity for researchers interested in the energy transition. It aims to integrate knowledge of engineering (e.g., energy and electrical engineering) and social sciences (economics, sociology, and anthropology) in a doctoral training program across 8 European research institutions and 15 industry actors. The POTENT consortium brings together a multidisciplinary research team from across Europe to train experts in port energy systems and develop key skills to deliver a just and sustainable energy transition. The energy transition of our ports is being rapidly acknowledged as a crucial tool as Europe undergoes the energy transition to climate neutrality and energy security. 
 
 The Marie Sklodowska-Curie Doctoral Network aims to increase mobility for students and therefore only accept students who have not lived more than 12 of the last 36 months in the country to which they apply. Please keep this rule in mind as you submit your applications. 
 
 You will be based at  The Technical University of Denmark  
 working with  Marie Münster 
 and  Josef Oehmen 
 as project leads and will focus on the topics of infrastructure adaptability and scalability, PtX technologies, de-risking strategies, and flexibility assessment. You will be applying methods such as sensitivity analysis, robust optimization, and stochastic modelling as you work on your project. You will be seconded with the Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) and Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping (Denmark) during the project. 
 
 You will be working on a project called  “Green Maritime fuel transition taking into account risk and uncertainty” 
 . During this project you will: 
 Assess promising green fuel production locations depending on local availability of resources and infrastructures as well as quantifying the cost risks via advanced sensitivity and uncertainty assessments. 
 Categorize options for adaptability in green fuel infrastructures and de-risk investments by considering the quantified key uncertainties and ensure solutions that are adaptable, scalable, and robust. 
 
 A main challenge in achieving a cost-efficient energy transition of the maritime sector is to identify where, when, which and what quantities of green fuels to produce in the future. Furthermore, the future is uncertain, and research identifying the most influential parameters as well as the uncertainty space for green fuels production costs is urgently needed. In addition, decision-makers need to de-risk future investment, thus future investments need to be adaptable, scalable, and robust. 
 
 To address these key challenges the project will apply and further develop large-scale integrated energy system models, with a focus on economic analysis of energy infrastructure, PtX and green fuels, as well as system integration. The main tool applied will be the modeling tool, Balmorel, which is built in GAMS. 
 
 During your studies you are expected to deliver: 
 a large-scale energy system modelling framework, including sector coupling opportunities and different green fuel production pathways, to provide insights into where, when and which fuels to produce along green corridors. 
 a modelling framework for assessing fuel costs risks and their underlying uncertainties along green corridors. 
 a structured catalogue of adaptability options (flexible usage of infrastructure, scalable, and robust) 
 improved energy system modelling framework with adaptability options integrated to compute the probability distribution for investments into green fuel infrastructure.
