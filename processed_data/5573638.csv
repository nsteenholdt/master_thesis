Start date is expected to be 1/9 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  Project 1: The project ‘Designing Disorder’ concerns amorphous metal oxides for electro- and photocatalysis.  Amorphous metal oxides show enormous potential for applications in electrocatalysis, an essential technology for the green transition. However, challenges in characterizing atomic structure in non-crystalline solid-state compounds hinders rational design of materials. The aim of this project is to unravel structure/property relations in amorphous and highly disordered transition metal oxides for electrocatalysis, so that the most active structural motifs can be identified, and new materials developed. The project includes material synthesis, high level structural analysis using especially X-ray and neutron total scattering methods such as Pair Distribution Function analysis, and  in situ  and  operando  studies of material formation and function. The focus is especially on structure analysis.   Project 2: The project “Metal oxo clusters as building blocks” concern metal oxo clusters, their chemistry and use in energy materials. While nanostructured polyoxometalate ions (POMs) have been known for more than a century, they are now receiving enormous attention, as new applications in energy technologies such as photocatalysis, batteries and supercapacitors are emerging. However, despite decades of POM studies, we have very little knowledge of their solution chemistry, although it is in this form that many of their properties emerge. The aim of this project is to use synchrotron X-ray scattering techniques to obtain an new understanding of nanoscale polyoxometalate clusters in solution, including studies of their growth and use during e.g. photocatalysts. The project includes material synthesis, high level structural analysis using especially X-ray total scattering methods such as Pair Distribution Function analysis and small angle X-ray scattering, and  in situ  and  operando  studies of material formation and function. The focus is especially on structure analysis.   Who are we looking for?  We are looking for excellent candidates within the field(s) of chemistry, nanoscience or related fields. Both project focuses on structural analysis. The ideel candidate thus has a strong background and experience in methods for analysis of e.g. X-ray diffraction or scattering data, including Rietveld refinement or Pair Distribution Funciton analysis, or other crystallographic methods. Experience in experimental chemistry and material synthesis is also an advantage, as will experience in python programming.   Our group and research- and what do we offer?  The work will be done in the Nanostructure group, led by Kirsten Marie Ørnsbjerg Jensen. The group works in materials chemistry and focuses especially on applications of synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering for structure studies of nanomaterials. We are an international and collaborative group, and the work done in the group ranges from computational work, focusing on development data analysis methods, to experimental work such as synthesis in the laboratory.   The group is a part of Department of Chemistry, Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. We are located in Copenhagen.   We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in dynamic and international research environment. Our research facilities include modern laboratories, and we are frequent users of synchrotron facilities in Europe and the US. Travels to these facilities should be expected.

The PhD programme:   Depending of your level of education, you can undertake the PhD programme as either:   Option A: A  three year full-time study  within the framework of  the regular PhD programme  (5+3 scheme),  if you already  have an education  equivalent to a relevant Danish master’s degree.   Option B: An up  to five year full-time study programme  within the framework of  the  integrated MSc and PhD  programme  (the 3+5 scheme), if you do not have an education  equivalent to a relevant Danish master´s degree  – but you  have  an education  equivalent to a Danish bachelors´s degree .   Option A: Getting into a position on the regular PhD programme    Qualifications needed for the regular programme  To be eligible for the regular PhD programme, you must have completed a degree programme, equivalent to a Danish master’s degree (180 ECTS/3 FTE BSc + 120 ECTS/2 FTE MSc) related to the subject area of the project, e.g. chemistry or nanoscience. For information of eligibility of completed programmes, see  General assessments for specific countries  and  Assessment database .   Terms of employment in the regular programme   Employment as PhD fellow is full time and for maximum 3 years.   Employment is conditional upon your successful enrolment as a PhD student at the PhD School at the Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen. This requires submission and acceptance of an application for the specific project formulated by the applicant.   The terms of employment and salary are in accordance to the agreement between the Ministry of Finance and The Danish Confederation of Professional Associations on Academics in the State (AC). The position is covered by the Protocol on Job Structure.   Option B: Getting into a position on the integrated MSc and PhD programme   Qualifications needed for the integrated MSc and PhD programme    If you do not have an education  equivalent to a relevant Danish master´s degree , you might be qualified for the integrated MSc and PhD programme, if you have an education equivalent to a relevant Danish bachelor´s degree. Here you can find out, if that is relevant for you:  General assessments for specific countries  and  Assessment database .     Terms of the integrated programme  To be eligible for the integrated scholarship, you are (or are eligible to be) enrolled at one of the faculty’s master programmes in chemistry or nanoscience.
