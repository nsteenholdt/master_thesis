The position is for 30 months and has no teaching requirements.   About the Project:  The positions are part of an ERC advanced project entitled ‘Anger Legitimised: Amplified Anger and its Rhetorics of Justification in the 21st century’ led by Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Atreyee Sen, Department of Anthropology University of Copenhagen. The broader project explores how diverse communities that feel their anger has been delegitimised seek to perform, communicate and justify this volatile emotion. The project looks to develop the concept of ‘a grammar of anger’, which will address the legitimation, transmission and ethics of collective, amplified anger in the contemporary era. It will compare the rhetorics and practices of this amplified anger in a range of sites (India, North Africa, USA, Amazonia, etc.) and across a range of thematic orientations (fury, venom, rage and wrath).  (Project overview - temporary)   Job Content  Postdoctoral position 1: The Study of Anti-female Anger and Activism in the US  This position is specifically part of a wider work-package (WP) entitled ‘Fury’, looking at contemporary manifestations, linkages, and globalization of gendered anger. This WP is coordinated by the PI, Dr Atreyee Sen. The successful candidate will be expected to conduct individual research into the currents, logics and expressions of anti-female anger in the US, that coalesces into political groups, ‘manospheres’, homosocial spaces, and social movements. E.g. the latter could include Incels, Trump supporters, and men’s rights activists.   Postdoctoral position 2: The Study of Postimperial Anger in Georgia, Europe  This position is specifically part of a WP entitled ‘Venom’, looking at embittered anger and  ressentiment  directed towards former colonial and imperial powers. This WP is coordinated by Dr Matthew Carey, Department of Anthropology, University of Copenhagen. The successful candidate will be expected to conduct individual research into the dynamics of postimperial anger in Georgia directed towards the former imperial power, Russia, and its citizens, both in the present-day context of immigration and potentially with regard to the recent past.   The postdocs will be responsible for designing and conducting their own sub-project within the broader context of the work package and the project as a whole. The research will rely primarily on fieldwork and the collection and analysis of qualitative data (both offline and online), and outputs will be primarily in the form of single- or co-authored academic publications, as well as more popular forms of dissemination (podcasts, media articles and interviews, public talks, exhibitions, etc.). Participation in academic conferences and/or workshops is expected.   The candidate will be employed at the Department of Anthropology, University of Copenhagen, and will be expected to reside primarily in the Denmark when not conducting research or engaging in research stays. The Department represents a broad approach to anthropology, expressed in regional foci, theoretical orientation, and methodology, which results in a dynamic practice of anthropology. The postdoc is expected to participate in the wider academic life of the department and to collaborate closely with other members of the project.   Qualifications  The successful candidate will have a PhD in anthropology or a related discipline within the social sciences or humanities.    For more about postdoc positions and qualification requirements, see the Ministry of Education and Research’s Memorandum on Job Structure for Academic Staff.   The candidates will be assessed according to the following qualifications:     Specialization: PhD degree in Anthropology or a related field.   Language: Excellent English (for postdoc 1 and 2); Proficient Georgian (and perhaps basic Russian for postdoc 2)   Methods: Proficiency in ethnographic data collection is required, ideally with experience of both digital and in-face fieldwork.    Analysis and writing: Demonstrable ability to engage in sophisticated theoretical analysis of ethnographic data.   Research experience:        For Postdoc 1: Experience conducting research in the US or on relevant themes for the project (emotions, affect, gendered relations, protest/resistance).   For Postdoc 2: Experience conducting research in Georgia or on relevant themes for the project (emotions, affect, postimperial relations, protest/resistance)       Strategy of the Faculty of the Social Sciences  The Department of Anthropology is part of the Faculty of Social Sciences. The Faculty is a successful academic community that strives to put knowledge into action by:     Engaging partners in the co-creation of knowledge, learning and social change.   Empowering our students to become reflective and responsible citizens who have the vision, knowledge and competences to change society for the better.
