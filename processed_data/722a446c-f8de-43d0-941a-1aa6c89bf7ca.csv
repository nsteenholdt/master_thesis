The ideal opportunity awaits you. At the Department of Environmental and Resource Engineering (DTU Sustain), we are seeking a highly motivated PhD student to advance our understanding of using smart materials for sustainable built environment control. In this interdisciplinary project funded by the EU Horizon program, you will have the opportunity to develop and utilize cutting-edge smart materials (e.g., metal-organic frameworks) to design a groundbreaking air-cleaning system that can achieve a substantial 30-50% reduction in associated energy consumption. The new system developed in this project will be tested in different climates across Europe.  
 You will have the opportunity to join top interdisciplinary scientists from all over the world and make a personal impact in solving some of the most critical challenges in the built environment. The position is also integrated into the Sections of Materials durability and Indoor environment. We offer creative and stimulating working conditions in a dynamic and international research environment, with recently renovated laboratory facilities and state-of-the-art equipment for material preparation, characterization, indoor air quality assessment, and prototype development. 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 You are enthusiastic and self-motivated, with a background in building technology, thermal engineering, mechanical engineering, material science, or chemical engineering, and a strong interest in smart materials (e.g., MOFs) and innovative building technologies. You are passionate about exploring novel built environment control methods, with a particular focus on how to integrate smart materials into energy-efficient indoor air quality control systems. You are excited by the opportunity to leverage state-of-the-art tools to investigate fundamental questions about pollutant adsorption/desorption in functional materials.  
 Preferred qualifications include experience in one or more of the following areas: 
 Indoor air quality measurements and analysis 
 Synthesis and characterization of smart materials
