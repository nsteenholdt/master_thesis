Do you wish to contribute to the development of energy efficiency within the green transition agenda and are you looking for a career in R&D or academia? Then we have a great opportunity! 
 
 We are looking for a highly motivated and skilled candidate with a master’s degree in STEM disciplines to join us as a PhD scholar. 
 
 We offer a multidisciplinary, international, and friendly atmosphere, encouraging creativity, diversity, empathy, and teamwork. You will have a great opportunity to build strong networks with internationally known researchers at DTU and other universities as well as industrial partners. 
 
 You will be affiliated with the Section on E-mobility and Prosumer Integration in the Division of Power and Energy Systems. Collaboration with neighboring sections is encouraged. The Section on E-mobility and Prosumer Integration undertakes internationally leading research and teaching in the field of EV technologies, charging infrastructure and flexibility, advanced power electronics, battery energy systems and hybrid AC-DC systems. The research in this section is multidisciplinary and the team is currently formed by 35 researchers from 15 different countries. 
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 This PhD position is connected to the ECO-Drive project, which aims to unlock the flexibility and significantly improve the efficiency of motor systems by overcoming the barriers to cost-effectively retrofitting motor applications with variable speed drive (VSD) power converters. Despite the well-recognized benefits of VSDs in reducing energy consumption and enhancing motor performance, approximately 80% of electric motors globally still operate without them due to current constraints to integrate them. 
 The ECO-Drive project introduces an innovative approach to integrate Silicon-Carbide (SiC) semiconductor devices and harmonic filters directly into VSD hardware. This integration will reduce costs, simplify retrofitting, and eliminate the need for shielded cables, inverter-duty motors, and bulky external filters. The resulting plug-and-play ECO-Drive will deliver clean sinusoidal outputs, enhanced IoT connectivity, and advanced data processing capabilities, setting a new standard in energy efficiency and user-friendly VSD technology. 
 The focus of this PhD position is to develop advanced control algorithms for these next-generation VSDs, ensuring robust performance and seamless integration into diverse motor applications. You will address key challenges such as minimizing electromagnetic interference, optimizing energy efficiency through innovative control and modulation techniques, and enabling modularized drive designs through parallelization. The controls will be performed in DTU’s Smart converter Lab. You will work closely with globally leading electric drives manufacturers and system operator at Bornholm island. 
 Your primary tasks will be: 
 Plan and manage your PhD project in collaboration with supervisors. 
 Define controlling algorithms for electric drives (knowledge about DSPs and power converter hardware are advantageous). 
 Test controlling functionality in a state-of-the art real-time experimental facility. 
 Assess the impact of new control algorithms on the overall efficiency of the electric drives with integrated LC filter. 
 Estimate the economic profitability of delivering the grid services with the electric drive assets. 
 
 A detailed project plan will be developed with the supervisors within the first two months after enrolment. 
 You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) in STEMS, with a preference in engineering, statistics, physics, mathematics, informatics or similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a master’s degree.  
 You should preferably have: 
 Excellent grades in your master program 
 Dedication and the desire to learn 
 Good programming skills (e.g., MATLAB and/or Python)  
 Ability to work effectively with data and applied statistics 
 Ability to present results in technical reports and prepare scientific papers 
 Ability to work in a project team and take responsibility for own research goals 
 Excellent in communicating and reporting in English 
 Previous experience on DSP programming is advantageous  
 Knowledge of power converters and drive hardware is advantageous 
 Basic knowledge of control theory is advantageous 
 
 Approval and Enrolment 
   
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see  DTU's rules for the PhD education
