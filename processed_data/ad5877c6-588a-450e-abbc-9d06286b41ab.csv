Data comes in different formats and the different programs typically have to be carefully put into workflows where the output format from one method needs to be changed to the input format of downstream methods. Furthermore, Biomedical research is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity. Data formats and standards exist in a chaotic tapestry, reflecting the diverse nature of experimental platforms and analytical tools. This heterogeneity necessitates laborious manual processing, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. There are “workflow wrappers” for some tasks, however, these are mainly suitable for sufficiently standardized tools using standardized data formats. However, even with these wrappers, most of the bioinformatician’s time in a project goes into this manual gluing of different tools with the data at hand. The efforts in this job concern tackling these challenges.   The Data Scientist will be located in the Gorodkin lab ( http://ivh.ku.dk/bioinformatics ), Center for non-coding RNA in Technology and Health (RTH), ( http://rth.dk ) at Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (IVH) ( http://ivh.ku.dk/english ), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences at University of Copenhagen and will over time closely interact with a range of national bioinformatics research groups and in the context of ELIXIR, both the national node ( https://elixir-denmark.org/ ) and the international node ( https://elixir-europe.org/ ). The Data Scientist will be a part of the Novo Nordisk Foundation funded BioGLUE infrastructure funded project.   Start date is 1 May 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter. The position is time-limited to one year, but with the possibility of making it permanent employment thereafter.     Our research and research group  The bioinformatics group has a strong profile in data analysis, algorithm development and in building bioinformatic tools, many involving computational RNA biology also relevant for this position. We have excellent computational infrastructure and access to supercomputing when needed. Our research environment is highly dynamic and international and stimulating with a wide range of activities from seminars, workshops, summer schools and retreats.     Your role and key responsibilities  In this job,  you will address the ""gluing"" of diverse and heterogeneous datasets from both a general perspective and in specific use cases matching parts of the Danish national bioinformatics environment. A key focus will be to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate the ""gluing"" of diverse and heterogeneous datasets, enabling intelligent and scalable integration workflows. The specific use cases comprise data in areas concerning RNA structure, CRISPR, mass spec, microbiome, genomics, transcriptomics and personalized medicine. Additionally, the role will also involve server and software maintenance tasks including ensuring a seamless computational infrastructure.   Your key responsibilities will be to:     Utilize LLMs to enable homogenization of heterogeneous datasets for seamless integration at a general level.   Work on and contribute to the use cases and the design relevant workflows for these.   Ensure advancements in LLM applications enters the infrastructure when relevant.   Document implementations, pipelines, methods and infrastructure configurations.   Collaborate with the ELIXIR related bioinformaticians and their research groups to evaluate the integrated data resources and their applicability.   Manage, maintain, and improve data storage solutions and computational infrastructure for bioinformatics workflows. In here contribute to build server capacity with connection to external supercomputing when/if needed.   Provide access the to the resources built within the infrastructure.   Incorporate user experience.   Provide training events both online and physically.       You and your qualifications  If you are enthusiastic about the described role, are highly dedicated and possess strong skills you can well be the right candidate key to obtain successful results. You will work in a bioinformatically multi-disciplinary environment and collaborate with other researchers internally in the group and with the collaborating groups in the Danish ELIXIR node and European ELIXIR hub.

Experience with machine learning.   Familiar with omics data analysis   Familiar with data standards & API systems   You have proficient communication skills   You have excellent English skills written and spoken   You are emphatic and a strong and supportive team player who can navigate in a multi-disciplinary context.
