The position is available from September 1st, 2022, or at a mutually agreed date. Very motivated and committed candidates with experience in cardiovascular physiology and animal models of human disease are invited to apply.   The employment as PhD fellow is full time and for 3 years. The position is fully funded and is conditioned upon the applicant’s successful enrollment as a PhD student at the Graduate School at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. This requires submission and acceptance of an application for the specific project formulated by the applicant.     Project description   Heart failure is a critical, clinical diagnosis characterized by shortness of breath at rest, fatigue, weakness and edema. Two categories of heart failure exists: Heart failure with reduced or with preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively). A weakened heart muscle causes HFrEF, whereas HFpEF hearts are too stiff to be filled sufficiently during diastole. Historically, focus has been on HFrEF, but HFpEF represents an unmet medical need due to the unknown underlying causes, and the lack of efficient, clinical treatment options.   The student will use an integrated approach – both cellular, intact organ and whole-animal experiments – to test novel treatment options for HFpEF. Ultrasound-based echocardiography can be applied to follow the development of heart failure in the individual animal. Isolated, beating hearts can be used to gauge the effect of changes in filling pressure. Histology tests fibrosis development and fluorescent dyes can be used to visualize the intracellular calcium handling in disaggregated cardiomyocytes.   We are looking for an exceptional candidate with a flair for animal experiments. One that will be able to master many skills in the laboratory using whole animals, intact organs and isolated cells.   Supervision   Principal supervisor is Associate Professor Morten B Thomsen.   Primary co-supervisor is Associate Professor Jens C Brings Jacobsen   Start   October 1st 2022 or soon thereafter   Job description   Your key tasks as a PhD student at are:     Plan, execute and evaluate independent research under supervision   Complete PhD courses or equivalent education corresponding to 30 ECTS points   Teach pregraduate students   Disseminate your research orally and written   Write a PhD thesis on the grounds of your project     Criteria for the assessment of candidates   We evaluate the candidates primarily based on the following criteria:     You must have qualifications corresponding to a master’s degree related to the subject area of the project i.e. physiology, biology, bioengineering, medicine, human biology, veterinary medicine, molecular biomedicine or similar.   Experience with animal (rodents) experiments is very desirable. Prior skills in animal experiments are preferred, but not required. The candidate will perform surgery (blood-vessel cannulation) and harvest organs for experimental purposes. The candidate should be able to master the procedures within the first few months after being accepted into the program.   Experience with echocardiography, isolated heart studies e.g. Langendorff or calcium imaging is highly meriting.   Basic knowledge of cardiac electrophysiology and hemodynamics   High proficiency in English is a benefit.
