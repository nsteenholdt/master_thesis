Start date is (expected to be) June 1st 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  Noncanonical 5’ capping of RNA molecules with metabolites, such as NAD and FAD, has recently been observed in many organisms, but in most cases the functional consequences of the capping remains unknown. In this project, the focus will be on the 5’metabolite capping of two important  E. coli  non-coding RNAs, which play a central role in the regulation of cellular growth and carbon storage. The aim of the project is to characterise the metabolite RNA capping of these non-coding RNAs and its regulatory consequences. The project involves classic  E. coli  genetics and RNA biology methods as well as specialised sequencing based methods for the detection of RNA capping.   Who are we looking for?  We are looking for candidates with a MSc degree in biochemistry, molecular biology or similar disciplines, who are interested in RNA-based gene regulation and want to pursue a scientific career. Previous experience with the molecular biology of  E. coli , RNA biology and/or sequencing-based methods will be an advantage, but is not a requirement.   We are looking for the following qualifications:     A strong interest in RNA-based gene regulation   Professional qualifications relevant to the PhD project   Good English language skills   Relevant work experience   Other relevant professional activities     Our group and research- and what do we offer?  The project is a collaboration between the Svenningsen group and the Vinther Lab, which are both from the Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen and located within the Copenhagen Biocenter. The Vinther Lab is interested in metabolite RNA capping and its regulatory consequences (recent publication highlight:  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37407817 ) and the Svenningsen Group focuses on bacterial gene regulatory mechanisms (recent publication highlight:  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36598190/ ). We offer stimulating working conditions in a creative, dynamic and international research environment and our facilities include modern laboratories and research equipment.
