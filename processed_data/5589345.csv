The PhD fellowship is available as of September 1 2022. The research project The PhD fellowship is part of the research project: ETHOS – Exploring Research Integrity Policies and Practices in ”the Houses of Science” led by Associate Professor Lise Degn at the Danish Centre for Studies in Research and Research Policy (CFA), Department of Political Science. The project focuses on how academic and public discourses shape the problem of research integrity and how such problematizations affect academic practices and perceptions. The PhD project particularly should focus on how integrity issues emerge in the daily lives of ‘work-floor’ academics, and should be based on ethnographic fieldwork in at least three research groups across Europe. Interested applicants may read more about the ETHOS project, and the initial outline of the PhD project  here . Job description  The successful candidate will be enrolled as a PhD student at the Graduate School Aarhus BSS, with the aim of completing a PhD degree at the PhD programme in Social Sciences and Business. While the successful candidate’s work will culminate in the submission of a PhD dissertation, she or he will be expected to participate in both research group research activities (e.g., workshops, seminars, etc.) throughout the period of her or his employment, as well as activities at the place of employment, the Danish Centre for Studies in Research and Research Policy.
