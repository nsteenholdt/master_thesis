The project is part of the research project “Constructing Sustainable Polymers From Carbon Dioxide”, financed by the Novo Nordisk Foundations grant NNF24OC0089906.   Start date is (expected to be) 1 June 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter.   The project  The project that the PhD candidates would be working on is developing transition-metal-catalyzed methodologies (e.g., using Fe, Co or Ni) to create polymers from CO2. The development of this reaction will enable the creation of plastics directly from CO2 with renewable feedstock chemicals using sustainably sourced metal catalysts. To realize this goal, a mechanistically guided approach to reaction development will be taken that combines kinetics, organometallic synthesis with method development. This technological breakthrough promises to serve as a cost-effective and potent carbon sequestration method, scalable to industrial levels, with significant societal benefits in the sustainable production of commodity materials, thus reducing our reliance on petrochemically derived plastics.   Who are we looking for?  We are looking for candidates within the field(s) of organic chemistry that must be proficient in English. Applicants can have a background in synthetic organic chemistry, methodology development, organometallic chemistry, mechanistic chemistry, or polymer chemistry. All candidates will be assessed in one pool.   Our group and research- and what do we offer?  The Day group is a newly established research group at the University of Copenhagen that will hire their first PhD candidates (two people) to join the group. The research conducted will focus on understanding fundamental organometallic chemistry to inform the rational reaction design of new catalytic methodologies that can be applied to address current challenges in sustainability. These topics range from the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals to the synthesis of new types of plastics.    As the first PhD candidates, they will be working alongside Prof. Day regularly and get consistent feedback, assistance, and support. Prof. Day has led numerous projects published in leading academic journals such as  Nature Catalysis ,  Nature Communications ,  J. Am. Chem. Soc. ,  Chem. Soc. Rev. , and  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed .
