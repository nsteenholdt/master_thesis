 Who are we? 
 EcoTree is a vibrant and successful French  greentech  startup with its international  headquarter in Copenhagen , aiming to make the world a greener place by planting and developing sustainable forests right here in Europe. 
 Six years ago, a group of friends from France quit their jobs and created EcoTree. They were truly convinced that  investing in Mother Nature should be something easy, accessible, and financially viable  in order to best engage people and companies in environmental- friendly action. 
 Since then, EcoTree has been growing rapidly and now has more than 55,000 individual tree-owners and close to 1,500 business clients. We’ve received many awards & institutional recognition, and we’ve recently been certified as a  B-Corp  organisation with distinction as ‘Best in the World’ in the Environment category!

 ✔️ Ability to understand & leverage both B2C and B2B communication drivers. 
 ✔️ Entrepreneurial mindset, with the ability to work independently on an initiative from the concept to the strategy and the execution. 
 ✔️ Min. 5 years of experience in similar positions.
