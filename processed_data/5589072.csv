The department has a well-established research area in the application of spectroscopy in the form of multivariate on-line sensors for food quality control and optimization of food manufacturing processes. We are now seeking to strengthen our profile in green analytics for promoting sustainable food production. The Associate Professor will be part of the Section for Food Analytics and Biotechnology (FAB), which is among the leading scientific environments within food quality control, sustainable food processing and plant food biotechnology. As a part of the Foodomics research group, the candidate will join a dynamic research environment dedicated to food quality control examined by advanced analytical methods, centered on a research infrastructure that spans near infrared (NIR), infrared (IR), Raman and Fluorescence spectrometers, GC/LC-MS systems, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometers. We are seeking an experienced and entrepreneurial candidate with a primary focus on non-destructive vibrational spectroscopy, with an emphasis on NIR spectroscopy. An essential part of the position is collaboration with external partners, such as other academic institutions and industry. Also, the candidate is expected to develop her/his research in collaboration with other research groups at UCPH FOOD; within food processing, food microbiology, food chemistry, food physics and food aroma/taste.   The Department of Food Science is internationally recognized for excellence in food science research and education, strong industrial collaboration and with a vibrant international environment, where English is the primary working language. The Department has the mission to contribute with new fundamental knowledge and innovative solutions for society and industry in order to support sustainable food production, food security and safety, as well as production of palatable and high-quality novel foods promoting human health and well-being.   The ideal candidate should have qualifications and research experience in following areas:     High throughput analysis using NIR spectroscopy including implementation of on-line sensors and associated applications, data collection and multivariate data processing   Vibrational spectroscopy of food/biological materials (Infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Hyperspectral Imaging)   Process analytical technology (PAT) and/or quality-by-design production optimization/control and quality control (QC) schemes   Multivariate data analysis (chemometrics/machine learning) of large data sets from spectroscopic sensors   A collaborative and innovative mind-set   International network and collaborations   Good teaching and supervising skills     Candidate preferences     Teaching experience in disseminating of vibrational spectroscopy   Teaching experience in disseminating of multivariate data analysis in relation to spectroscopic data   Experience in programming languages (Matlab, Python, C/C++ or R)   A documented track record in attracting funding and experience as PI or Co-PI.     In addition to the above mentioned qualifications, applicants are required to have a relevant PhD degree, e.g. within optical sensors, spectroscopy or analytical chemistry.   Applicants are required to have university level teaching experience, documented teaching competencies and must be able to explain and reflect upon own teaching practice and portfolio. Formal pedagogical training or supervision equivalent to the University of Copenhagen teacher training programme for assistant professors is required.   Duties include the applicant’s own research, development of the field, maintenance of the spectroscopy lab, assessment tasks, grant applications, and research management such as supervision and training of research fellows and other staff. The successful applicant must also teach, supervise, prepare and participate in examinations, and fulfill other tasks requested by the Department.   Assessment of applicants  will primarily consider their level of documented, original scientific production at an international level, including contributions to developments in their field, as well as their documented teaching qualifications. Managerial and out-reach qualifications of applicants including ability to attract external funding will also be considered.   Six overall criteria apply for associate professor appointments at the University of Copenhagen. The six criteria (research, teaching, societal impact, organisational contribution, external funding and leadership) are considered a framework for an overall assessment of the candidates. Furthermore, each candidate must be assessed according to the specific requirements stated in the job advertisement.
