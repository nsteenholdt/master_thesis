The position is for 2 years and is available from September 1, 2025, or soon thereafter. The university is keen for its staff to reflect the diversity of society and thus welcomes applications from all qualified applicants regardless of their personal background. Research context This postdoc project is part of the Center for Ecological Dynamics in a Novel Biosphere (ECONOVO), funded by the Danish National Research Foundation. Overall ECONOVO aims to provide new perspectives on the future of the biosphere - to learn more please visit our website here: ECONOVO - Center for Ecological Dynamics in a Novel Biosphere - Aarhus University ( au.dk )  The position This postdoc project will be part of the ECONOVO research theme 1: Diversity Dynamics, focused on understanding biodiversity dynamics in novel ecosystems (NEs) past and present. This position is focused on understanding the diverse roles humans might have in ecosystems globally by applying a functional trait perspective that integrates cross-cultural ethnographic idata (from, for instance, D-PLACE), palaeodemography (from, for instance, HYDE), and estimates of human energy consumption. Humans have evolved the unique, culturally and technologically mediated ability to act in multiple different ecological roles – for instance, as foragers, pastoralists, farmers, industrialists – and these variable socio-economic constellations determine their interactions with the environment. Our aim is to understand these ecological interactions globally in a data-driven macroecological approach, and to articulate these analyses with projections of future climate, human energy consumption, and human niche dynamics differentiated by socio-economic constellation. The postdoc is expected to lead an investigation that combines functional trait theory, metabolic theory and energetics, macroecological modelling, and human socio-ecology to better understand the variable roles adopted by human communities practicing different economies within ecosystems, and their impacts on these – past, present, and future. We aim for the investigation to encompass a temporal scope spanning from the Middle Pleistocene to potential future scenarios. We are open to hearing the candidate’s take on this and would like the postdoc to contribute ideas and concepts to the project and lead at least two high-quality papers in this research area. We also emphasize the importance of engaging fully in the center's outreach and educational efforts, while also supporting and encouraging collaborative work with ECONOVO colleagues, including students. This collaboration involves sharing skills and contributing to problem-solving within the postdoc’s area of expertise. Teaching The position will involve some teaching as agreed upon with the Head of the Department and the project PIs. Knowledge exchange The successful applicant will be expected to exchange knowledge with various sectors of society and to contribute actively to public debate in areas related to the position. Qualifications Applicants must have a PhD degree in ecology, computation anthropology, cultural evolutionary studies or equivalent qualifications. Demonstrated capability in macroecological statistical modelling and prior engagement with relevant cross-cultural datasets, for instance, D-PLACE or HYDE, is a positive attribute. The individual appointed in this position will need to show collaborative expertise, a demonstrated history of publishing at a high international level, and have good command of English. Applicants who do not have English as their first language must demonstrate excellent English language writing skills and fluency. The research activities will be evaluated in relation to the actual research time. We therefore encourage applicants to specify any periods of leave they may have had without research activities (e.g. maternity/paternity leave), so we can subtract these periods from the span of their academic career when evaluating their productivity. The application must be submitted in English and include motivation letter including a 1-page outline of your ideas for the postdoc research project, 2-page CV (including number of citations and H-index from Google Scholar), full list of publications, as well as educational documentation (copies of diplomas for Master and PhD degrees, in English or Danish). Only submitted publications will be assessed; a list of publications is not sufficient. As a result, applications without submitted publications will not be assessed. Please upload a maximum of two publications alongside your application.  Professional references or recommendations should not be included. Applicants who are selected for an interview may be asked to provide professional references. Applicants seeking further information are invited to contact: Professor Felix Riede or Center director Professor Jens-Christian Svenning, phone +45 28992304, e-mail: svenning@bio.au.dk.

The postdoc will join the ECONOVO team within the Section for Ecoinformatics & Biodiversity (ECOINF) as well as the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Studies. Key international associates to ECONOVO will also be involved. Together ECONOVO, ECOINF, and the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Studies form a cooperative, interdisciplinary research network with extensive international involvement. Postdocs and PhD students are encouraged to collaborate within the group, across departments, and with other universities. What we offer  The selected applicant is offered:  * An engaging, ambitious, and friendly research habitat, encouraging open dialogue within  and between assorted research disciplines  * a working environment with teamwork, close working relations, network activities among  young scientists and social activities  * a workplace characterized by professionalism, equality, and a healthy work-life balance  * access to well-developed research infrastructure  * office space and shared equipment.
