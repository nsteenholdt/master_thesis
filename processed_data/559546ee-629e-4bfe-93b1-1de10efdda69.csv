The position is available from 01 July 2025 or later. You can submit your application via the link under 'how to apply'. Title: PhD position in data-driven scratch-based material characterization Research area and project description: Research area and project description: This PhD project will be based in the Mechanics and Materials section of the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering at Aarhus University, which has research focus on Structural Mechanics and Materials Engineering. This project has a multidisciplinary nature and aims to investigate a novel approach to characterize mechanical properties of metallic and polymeric materials, including elastic and plastic properties and fracture toughness using micro scratching techniques. The goal of the project is to simultaneously measure a variety of mechanical properties by harnessing and analysing the extensive amount of information encoded in the scratch topography. The proposed approach exploits symbolic regression (an equation-based ML method) to establish physics-based, interpretable analytical models that express material properties in terms of topographical and dynamical features. As a part of the project, systematic collection and analysis of numerical and experimental data will be carried out. The project utilizes both numerical and experimental techniques, leveraging high-performance computing resources and state-of-the-art experimental facilities available at the AU Tribology Lab. The project has received financial support from the Independent Research Fund Denmark (DFF, Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond). You will be joining an innovative and exciting cross-disciplinary research team which has excellent infrastructure and access to state-of-the-art experimental and computational facilities for the project. You are expected to autonomously carry out research work under supervision. You may co-supervise students (MSc and BSc) in their projects. You will expand your research portfolio and share your research findings through high-impact publications and presentations at international conferences, contributing to innovative material characterization techniques with enhanced accuracy, flexibility, and automation.
