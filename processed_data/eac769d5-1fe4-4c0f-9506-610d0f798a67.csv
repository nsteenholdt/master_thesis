PlantTip is a joint project of Aarhus University, Copenhagen Business School and Democracy X, and collaborates with, amongst others, the Stockholm Resilience Centre and the chair of International Political Economy and Environmental Politics, ETH Zurich. The interdisciplinary project takes a dual-track approach, combining experimental research (under the lead of CBS) with simulation-based modelling (under the lead of Aarhus University).
