We welcome applications from candidates with backgrounds in Danish studies, Scandinavian studies, linguistics or ethnology.

We are looking for a motivated PhD candidate who will join  TRANSITION – Center for Changing Urban and Rural Lives , a new Center of Excellence set to open on February 1, 2025. It is funded for up to 10 years by the Danish National Research Foundation (https://dg.dk/en/) and represents a collaboration between the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Copenhagen and the National Museum of Denmark.    TRANSITION – Changing Urban and Rural lives   Worldwide, the transition from predominantly rural to urban-centric societies marks one of the most significant shifts in human history, with profound implications for culture, language, and identities.

The aim of the center’s research is to uncover and understand the cultural history and lived experiences of people during the 20th-century transition from agrarian societies to today’s post-industrial world.

The center’s materials provide opportunities to explore ordinary people’s experiences with linguistic encounters between rural and urban settings. Thus, possible themes may include, for example, ‘the mobile dialect speaker’, experiences of encountering other linguistic codes and norms in relation to migration from rural to urban areas, or shifting attitudes toward dialect speakers over time. It is not a requirement to include linguistic dialect descriptions; the focus can also be on individuals’ reported accounts of linguistic encounters.
