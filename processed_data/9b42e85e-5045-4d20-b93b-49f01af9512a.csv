The starting date is expected to be 1 June 2025, or as agreed upon consultation. The postdoc position is a non-tenured full-time position of 1 or 2 years, including 3 – 6 months of teaching obligations. The research will be conducted as part of the European Research Council Starting Grant project ‘Moral Elites: The Historical Positioning of Civil Society Leaders in National Moral Economies’ (MORALITES). The project team will consist of one PhD, three postdocs, and the PI.  The central objectives of the overall project are 1) to theorize   the concepts of moral elites and moral economies to capture the role of civil society elites in influencing the ideational basis of society, 2) to explain   how the positions and position-takings of civil society elites have shaped the historical trajectory of moral economies, and 3) to compare   the influence of civil society elites in different national moral economies.  The project will analyse the historical positioning of civil society leaders by applying methods such as 1) Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Social Network Analysis on biographical and career data, and 2) NLP Topic Modelling to analyse textual data.  The project is divided into five work packages focusing on four country cases: 1) Italy, 2) Denmark, 3) Poland, 4) the UK, and 5) a methods and analysis work package. The post doc position is attached to the UK work package and will be concerned with collecting and analyzing data across work packages.  The research conducted will be team based and oriented towards delivering on the project objectives. Taking the project framework into consideration, applicants are required to outline their reflections on how to study the historical positions and position-takings of civil society leaders.
