The position is funded for 2 years with a start date of 15 April 2025 or as soon as possible thereafter. The position will be based at the Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen. Information on the department can be found at  www.globe.ku.dk   Our research  You will join the Conservation Palaeogenetics & Palaeoecology Group at the Center for GeoGenetics led by Assistant Professor Ana Prohaska. We work at the interface of palaeoecology, ancient genetics, evolutionary biology, and conservation science to understand how species and ecosystems responded to past environmental change and how this understanding can inform conservation decision-making today. Our focus is on recovering genetic diversity relevant for the preservation of Earth’s contemporary biodiversity into the future. To achieve this, we also actively develop experimental techniques to access previously unavailable information about ancient populations and ecosystems. For more information about the group and our research, please see:  globe.ku.dk/research/geogenetics/prohaska-group/   You will also be part of the newly established Centre for Ancient Environmental Genomics. This is an interdisciplinary research centre committed to unlocking the vast, yet largely untapped research potential of ancient environmental genomics by enhancing key experimental and computational capabilities. The goal is to study community-wide and population-level processes on an unprecedented temporal and spatial scale to help resolve fundamental questions about the history of life on Earth. The centre brings together a diverse team of researchers with backgrounds in geology, chemistry, genetics, ecology, evolutionary biology, computer science, statistics, and more.   Your Position  You will be part of the team leading a new project funded by the Novo Nordisk Exploratory Interdisciplinary Synergy programme.    Understanding ecological interactions—between species and their environments—is crucial for maintaining and restoring ecosystems under growing environmental stress. However, studying these interactions holds significant technical challenges. Traditional methods struggle to provide direct, quantitative, and temporally resolved data due to the difficulty of observing or sampling living organisms and their remains. We aim to develop a new approach to reconstruct contemporary and past ecological interactions: direct stable isotope analysis of DNA fragments retrieved from environmental samples ( iso-eDNA ). This approach bridges, for the first time, three distinct fields—stable isotope geochemistry, environmental DNA, and ecological modelling—to enable the reconstruction of ecological interactions with unprecedented detail and scope, even in the absence of organisms or their remains. The approach has the potential to revolutionise our ability to predict and manage ecological processes important for biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation and food security.   Your role will involve developing and implementing procedures to accurately capture environmental DNA fragments of taxonomic interest. These fragments will then be used for stable isotope analysis to track spatio-temporal variation in stable isotope signatures of target taxa. You will utilise and, where needed, modify advanced molecular biology techniques to capture DNA fragments with an unprecedented level of precision and purity. You will be part of a highly interdisciplinary research team spanning four academic institutions in Denmark, Finland and the UK. While the position is primarily lab-based, the role also offers opportunities for short-term fieldwork activities. In addition to the main project tasks, you will have an opportunity to contribute to other ongoing projects within the group.   Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:     Designing, testing and implementing experiments, workflows, and protocols for capturing target DNA with high precision and purity.   Working closely with an interdisciplinary team to develop the innovative iso-eDNA method.   Conducting research in a vibrant, international environment to push the boundaries of environmental DNA research.   Participating in the scientific activities of the group and the centre.   Staying up to date with technological developments.   Working collaboratively with other members of the group and the centre.     Advisor will be Assistant Professor Ana Prohaska.    More information is available upon request. We encourage you to contact us if you have any questions about the project and the position (contact details given below).   Your Profile  We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with the following competencies and experience.   Essential Experience and Skills:     PhD in molecular biology, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, synthetic biology, biophysics, chemical engineering or related fields.   Extensive experience in designing and performing laboratory experiments, preferably with focus on enzymes and molecular interactions.   Proven problem-solving skills in developing and/or optimizing laboratory techniques in biology and/or chemistry.   High attention to detail to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of experimental results.   Excellent written and oral communication skills.   Ambition, strong work ethic, and good interpersonal skills.   Track record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals.   Ability to organize time and work effectively and responsibly, both independently and in teams.   Enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research projects and collaboration with scientists across various disciplines.   Fluency in both written and spoken English (due to the institute's international profile).     Desirable Experience and Skills:     Familiarity with target DNA enrichment methods.   Experience with ancient DNA and/or environmental DNA laboratory techniques.   Proficiency in using bioinformatics tools to design capture probes, analyse sequencing data, and assess the specificity and efficiency of DNA capture.   Understanding of stable isotope ratio analysis and its application in ecological and evolutionary studies.     Place of employment  The place of work is at the Center for GeoGenetics, Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen. We offer supportive, creative, and stimulating working conditions within a dynamic and international research environment. Our research facilities include a LEAF GOLD certified molecular lab, designed for generating genomic-scale datasets from both modern and ancient specimens, complemented by high-capacity computational servers adept at handling such data.   The Globe Institute is committed to creating an inclusive and diverse environment where employees and students can belong and thrive (https://globe.ku.dk/about/diversity-programme/). All qualified applicants will receive full consideration. Candidates who, through their research, teaching, and/or service, contribute to diversity and competencies of our Institute are encouraged to apply.    The University of Copenhagen strives to offer a family friendly and flexible working environment with a sustainable balance between work- and private life, including parental leave schemes (up to 47 weeks for both parents) and up to six weeks of paid holidays per year. Researchers that have not been tax liable in Denmark for the last 10 years can apply for a special (reduced) tax scheme. The university offers a variety of services for international researchers and accompanying families.   Terms of employment  The average weekly working hours are 37 hours per week.   The position is a fixed-term position limited to a period of 2 years. The starting date is on 15 April 2025 or based on an agreement.   Salary, pension and other conditions of employment are set in accordance with the Agreement between the Ministry of Taxation and AC (Danish Confederation of Professional Associations) or other relevant organisations. Currently, the monthly salary starts at 38,000 DKK/approx. 5,000 EUR (April 2024 level). Depending on qualifications, a supplement may be negotiated.
