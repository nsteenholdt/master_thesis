 You will be part of a research project in collaboration between DTU Physics and DTU Nanolab on developing machine-learning potentials for atomic-scale simulations of materials, and for advancing our deep learning methods for automated and quantitative analysis of atomic-resolution electron microscopy images. 
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 You will be responsible for developing methods for modelling defect creation in two-dimensional materials by using and developing modern interatomic potentials based on machine learning, supplemented by numerical quantum mechanical methods (Density Functional Theory, DFT). You will also be analysing experimental data with machine learning models and contribute to the development of these machine learning models. You will be part of a group focussing on developing machine learning models to push the boundaries for what is possible to achieve with modern electron microscopy, in particular with respect to real-time data analysis and minimisation of beam effects and beam artefacts. The methods will have general applicability with a focus on optically active defects for quantum communication and quantum computing. 
 
 You will be employed in the CAMD group consisting of four faculty members and 15 PhD students and postdocs. You will be collaborating with the experimental scientists in DTU Nanolab, a leading laboratory for electron microscopy.  
 
 During your employment as a PhD student, you will acquire expert skills in 
 Modern atomic-scale simulation methods, including Density Functional Theory. 
 State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, in particular equivariant neural networks for atomic scale simulations, and convolutional neural networks for image analysis. 
 Development of scientific software. 
 Applications of these methods to Transmission Electron Microscopy, two-dimensional materials and quantum technology.
