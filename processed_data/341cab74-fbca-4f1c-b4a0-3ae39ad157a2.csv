You can find the application deadline and the application link at the end of this advertisement. IDEAL4GREEN: Techno-economic assessment of microgrid investments and operation under sector coupling scenarios The project will focus on techno-economic modelling of electricity smart grids: (1) investment and operation models, including generation, storage, and flexible demand for electricity, including heating/cooling and mobility components. (2) Develop/extend a model of the macro energy system to include microgrid investments. (3) Develop a social cost-benefit analysis tool for assessment of smart grid projects. (4) Develop scenarios and use cases to apply the models. (5) Derive tariffication strategies for microgrids. (6) Policy recommendations for the design and regulation of microgrids. About the Department of Economics at CBS The Department of Economics provides research, teaching, and knowledge exchange within the core areas of economics, i.e., microeconomics, macroeconomics, and quantitative methods. The Department is especially active in business-related, applied economic research, and comprises three research centres: Copenhagen School of Energy Infrastructure (CSEI), Centre for Innovation (CFI), and Pension Research Centre (PeRCent). Core research areas of the Department of Economics are: Behavior, Incentives and Economic Design Design Employment and the Functioning of Labor Markets Energy, Environment and Resources Firm Behavior, Innovation and the Functioning of Markets Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation Globalization, Migration and Urbanization;  Quantitative/Empirical Methods and Data Science Welfare: Education, Health Care and Pensions The Department of Economics has a strong research focus and has been successful in fundraising activities. It is currently hosting research projects supported by the Danish/EU research councils, as well as private foundations and companies. About the Copenhagen School of Energy Infrastructure The Copenhagen School of Energy Infrastructure (CSEI) conducts research in tomorrow’s energy infrastructure from an economic policy point-of-view to ensure a successful transition towards a new sustainable European Energy Infrastructure based on volatile and largely renewable energy sources. CSEI is established in the form of a European research centre at CBS’ Department of Economics and delivers expertise and new knowledge as well as education within energy infrastructure in close cooperation with stakeholders from the sector, the European Commission and society at large. About the IDEAL4GREEN Doctoral Network The IDEAL4GREEN project is an EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie PhD training network focused on the urgent challenges of climate change and the global shift towards sustainable energy systems. It focuses on developing and integrating microgrids, which are crucial in managing the variability of renewable resources and achieving decarbonisation targets. The project proposes a comprehensive doctoral training network aimed at developing skilled engineers with interdisciplinary and intersectoral expertise. This network diverges from conventional university-based research, maintaining strong industry links and emphasising practical implementation. IDEAL4GREEN consists of 8 beneficiaries and 11 partner organisations, recruiting 15 doctoral candidates to undertake research on microgrids' planning, design, operation, control, and impact assessment. The research encompasses innovative frameworks and methodologies for integrating microgrids and transforming traditional grids into sustainable energy systems. This includes developing advanced control algorithms, cybersecurity, improving mechanisms for microgrid islanding and reconnection, and enhancing the resilience and reliability of interconnected microgrid systems. The project also explores the planning, policy, and economic feasibility of interconnected grids and microgrids. It emphasises creating complete and integrated microgrid design frameworks, utilising integrated energy system modelling, and investigating regulatory policies. In terms of training, the DCs will engage in a mix of academic and industrial experiences, including secondments and networking meetings, ensuring their exposure to both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The training program covers various aspects, such as advanced technical skills, collaborative communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability.
