We offer the chance to join a dynamic and international research environment as a PhD student in the Section for Scientific Computing at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. The position is fully funded and part of a five year-long project titled 'Scalable Optimization for Data Science' which is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Our goal is to develop new computational methods for detecting and exploiting various kinds of complex rank structure in optimization problems that arise in data science.  
 
 Together with the project group, you will help shape and develop a new generation of optimization methods for increasingly large and complex problems within data science. Since we will focus on exploiting hidden mathematical structure in problem formulations and data sets, the potential applications are wide-ranging.  
 
 Responsibilities and qualifications 
 
 As one of three PhD students, you will contribute to the design of new, fast computational methods for optimization problems with certain types of structure such as rank-structure and/or sparsity. You will also have the opportunity to apply these methods to real datasets as proof of concept.  
 
 You will work closely with the rest of the project team and be expected to:  carry out research under supervision and disseminate findings  
 participate in scientific activities such as conferences, workshops, summer schools, etc.
