 The deployment of AI in healthcare is often hampered by the gap between technical solutions and clinical needs. In this PhD project, your job will be to develop AI-driven feedback models that should serve as a collaborator for clinicians while they perform fetal ultrasound screening scans.  
 
 DTU Compute's Section for Visual Computing invites applications for a 3-year PhD position.  
 
 Description 
 
 Explainable AI (XAI) is typically developed by AI scientists for AI scientists, seeking to give insight into the AI's inner workings rather than giving feedback that is useful to the user - in this project, a clinician performing a fetal ultrasound scan. This PhD position aims to be part of a new paradigm of explainable AI, moving from attempting to explain how AI decisions are made to providing tailored explanations to the user. Ultimately, this project aims to develop AI-driven feedback tools that train and support clinicians in obtaining a standardized, high level of ultrasound image quality by providing feedback during the scan.  
 
 We offer an exciting interdisciplinary collaboration between DTU Compute, the Pioneer Centre for AI's collaboratory for Causality and Explainability, and the Copenhagen Academy for Medical Education and Simulation (CAMES).  
 
 This scholarship is funded by the Pioneer Centre for AI's collaboratory for Causality and Explainability. The Pioneer Centre for AI is located at the University of Copenhagen, with partners at Aarhus University, Aalborg University, The Technical University of Denmark, and the IT University of Copenhagen. There will be a cohort of PhD students starting during the fall of 2022 across the partner universities. PhD students at the Pioneer Centre for AI will have extraordinary access computing resources, to international researchers across many disciplines within computer sciences and other academic areas, as well as courses and events at the centre, and meaningful collaboration with industry, the public sector, and the start-up ecosystem. Centre website: Aicentre.dk. http://Aicentre.dk  
 
 Responsibilities 
 
 During this PhD program, you are expected to:  Develop (X)AI-driven feedback models for fetal ultrasound in collaboration with a team of PhD students, clinicians and engineers  
 Develop quantitative assessment of different feedback modes to obtained personalized feedback for the clinician  
 Publish scientific papers and present research results in top AI and medical imaging venues (NeurISP. ICLR, ICML, MICCAI, TMI, MedIA)  
 Do research during the PhD program at other units of the Pioneer Centre and abroad.  
 Work as a teaching assistant in two or three 5 ECTS courses at DTU  
 
 
 Qualifications 
 
 Candidates should have the following required skills:  A strong passion and motivation to work in an interdisciplinary team consisting of clinicians, engineers and AI scientists  
 A master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar in Computer Science, Informatics, Computer Engineering, Applied Mathematics or equivalent  
 Proven experience in Python  
 Hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks  
 High level of motivation and innovation  
 Excellent written and communication skills in English  
 
 
 Approval and Enrolment 
 
 The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules  
 
 Assessment 
 
 The assessment of the applicants will be made by the Pioneer Centre.  
 
 We offer
