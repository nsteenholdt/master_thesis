You will be part of an interdisciplinary research group in  Complexity and Big Data Epidemiology , which aims at understanding and acting upon complex public health issues by exploring large national and international datasets, including nationwide registers.     Our research  We offer a creative and stimulating working environment in an international and interdisciplinary research group. Health is a complex phenomenon, and we study the social, environmental, and biological factors determining health and disease. We also aim to elucidate the underlying biological and social mechanisms that might explain these effects.

Another project involves multi-level analyses of the complex interactions between chronic disease and labor market attachment in the large longitudinal  Well-being in Hospital Employee Study . The projects will aim at integrating newer methods from precision medicine and complexity science to investigate the complex interplay between social, environmental and health factors. Applying these methods will allow us to look at dynamic interactions between several of these dimensions simultaneously.
