 ‘Zero Hidden Hunger EU’ is a Horizon Europe funded research project aiming to provide estimates of the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies and their associated health costs, focused on high-risk population subgroups. The aim is to provide the best possible evidence to develop context-specific, tailored food focused solutions to ensure adequate supply of vitamins and minerals from diets from sustainable sources. The project runs over 4 years (2024-2027) and gathers 19 partners from 12 European countries in a collaboration between top universities and research centres, as well as expert non-profit organisations and the private sector. 
 The post doc will be responsible for estimating prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies using statistical methodology such as linear mixed models, the bootstrap and delta method, and meta analytic approaches for aggregated and individual-level data from the project database, encompassing large-scale data from approx. 15-20 countries. The work will also involve imputation of missing values and subsequent spatial modelling and mapping of prevalences and possibly also machine learning to establish prediction models of micronutrient deficiency. 
 The post doc is expected to explore and extend existing statistical methodology, in theory and through simulations as needed, analyse data and write scientific publications and contribute substantially to other work packages in the EU project and other tasks at NIPH, as appropriate. The post doc is also expected to interact with other project partners and to be involved in various project activities. 
 When evaluating applications, the following qualifications are expected: •    A PhD degree within a relevant field (such as biostatistics, data science, or statistics) •    In-depth experience in programming (such as defining functions, looping, and mark down scripts) and advanced statistical analyses using R •    Excellent communication skills in spoken and written English •    Documented experience with writing and publishing scientific papers in relevant, international peer-reviewed scientific journals 
 It will be considered an advantage to have: •    Documented research experience in the fields of biostatistics, data science, nutritional epidemiology, and/or related fields  •    Experience with large-scale data analysis in a food or nutrition context 
 Research environment The successful candidate will be joining the research group of Geographical and Register-based Epidemiology at NIPH, SDU, in Copenhagen. The research group consists of epidemiologists and statisticians, involved in a wide range of research projects related to climate, health, and the environment. Moreover, the post doc will be joining the ‘Zero Hidden Hunger EU’ project as task leader on several designated tasks in work package 4.  
 Suitable candidates will be invited for an online or on-site informal interview, as appropriate, after the application deadline.
