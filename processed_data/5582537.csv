The project strives to understand why the majority of young women who in upper secondary have selected a science study program refrain from continuing into post-secondary science and engineering. Science teaching has been pointed out as a key medium for understanding the gendered in- and exclusions of young women and how these mechanisms set the scene for their higher education choices.

Classroom observations of teaching and focus-group interviews with a broader groups of students will be conducted to ensure an extensive focus. Focus will be on ‘celebrated identities’ in science settings, how they are performed and how they relate to young women and their experiences with science, their life in general and how their thoughts of the future develop throughout upper secondary.
