 About you: 
 You have a positive attitude and a professional curiosity that challenges known solutions, and you creatively join the team’s problem solving of challenges, often to which no known solution exists. You are eager to become a part of a team that handles all sorts and all sizes of tasks - some tasks need a lot of innovativeness; some less. Some are extremely complicated; others are straight forward.  
 You thrive in a dynamic and developing environment, where you can challenge your skills and knowledge, without compromising with the quality. You are working well under know deadlines, and recognize the benefit of team work, and working together for the common goal. You are confident in communicating in English with both customers and team members.  On a daily basis where dedication, commitment and quality awareness are key words, you will be met by customers individual technical challenges, and you want to support them getting the best possible technology solution for their particular problem. 
   
 Together with the development team, your primary tasks will be:  
 ➢ Develop embedded software for microcontrollers (often ARM based STM32 processor) ➢ Embedded digital signal processing, filter design, etc. ➢ Develop python and C# tools to support the embedded development ➢ Contribute to the development of tools and processes in connection with the team’s  collective competencies  ➢ Specify and document solutions ➢ Sparring with the hardware team  
   
 We imagine that  you have a bachelor or master’s degree in electrical engineering  and that you have at least  three years of experience in embedded development  on a high professional level.  You have a personal interest in being up-to-date in the line of your professional field. Being an active and curious DIY, using your professional skills solving everyday non-work challenges is an absolute plus. A basic understanding of hardware is needed since many of these tasks are closely tied to hardware.
