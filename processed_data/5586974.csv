A position as consultant, at the Department of Breast Surgery, Herlev Hospital, is vacant for occupation 01st of July 2022   We are looking for a specialist in breast surgery with a broad international experience in oncoplastic techniques and research. The main task will be to supervise experienced specialists in the field.   The Department of Breast Surgery is headed by a breast surgeon, who reports directly to the managing director. The department has two sections. One placed at Herlev Hospital and one placed at Rigshospitalet. We have trained breast-care nurses at both units.  A physical fusion of the two sections is planned to take place in 2022.   All collaborative functions are available at both Herlev Hospital and Rigshospitalet with dedicated breast radiologists, pathologists, plastic surgeons and oncologists. The department has a highly specialized function within breast surgery and treats only patients with diseases in the breast. We have oncoplastic and reconstruction surgery in collaboration with the departments of Plastic surgery at both Herlev Hospital and Rigshospitalet.   The plan is, that you within a year will be able to work in a fixed alternation between outpatient clinic and surgical procedures. Typical two days each place and one day with ad hoc functions. You will be part of a team of experienced specialists, with both surgeons and trained breast-care nurses. There is MDT every morning and time is set aside for preparation. We expect involvement in the research in the department.   The department is characterized by a good working environment and an innovative quality culture. We want to be open and developing in the field of breast cancer. You will therefore have the opportunity to emboss the department with ideas and improvements.   We are looking for an international capacity in the field, and therefor only expect that you can read and speak Danish at a low level when you start. During the first year we will expect that your Danish knowledge will improve so much, that you after a year independently can handle the complete patient treatment. You need Danish authorization. The department is fully digitized, and you must be able to learn and master the electronic patient record from Epic® called SP (Sundhedsplatformen).   You will be employed at Herlev and Gentofte Hospital with Rigshospitalet as a sub function. Your workplace can be both Rigshospitalet and the Herlev-Gentofte section, since you should supervise the surgeons in both places. The working hours are calculated at 38.5 hours per week and there are occasional operations until 6 pm. This allows for hours for time off.   Our vision is to create the best breast surgery department at an international level, where the treatment and care provided to patients are on a par with the best international standard.   We wish :   • That everyone should feel well treated   • To combine high professional quality and patients' perception of quality in connection with contact with the department.   • Creating results through commitment, development and professionalism   • To be experienced as an attractive workplace with open dialogue, teamwork, good manners and security.     You get responsibility for and influence on :   • That the department can offer patients a treatment at a highly specialized professional level.   • To optimize the collaboration with our internal and external partners.   • To support research and development activities.   Our expectations to you are good communication, collaboration skills, ability to overview patient histories and a focus on well-being and competence development. We expect that you will profile the department professionally both internally and externally through your personality and professionalism, and that you show drive. In all contexts you show great respect for patient care and the many challenges in the field.   The department is affiliated with the University of Copenhagen and has students in clinical residence. A professor and two clinical associate professors are attached to carry out this teaching. The department is also part of the teaching department for the specialist medical education in surgery and plastic surgery.
