As digitalization affects all aspects of our daily life, the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) has defined it as one of its main strategic pillars. By this PhD-project you will be offered the unique opportunity to engage yourself in this endeavor towards an improved use of digitalization, both scientifically via the project's research content, and strategically as member of a Digitalization Task Force that operates across DTU's departments. The primary scientific objective concerns the design and implementation of digital shunts for controlling and sensing structural vibrations via piezoelectric or electromagnetic transducers. The project requires a multi-physics solution strategy, in which novel mathematical and numerical solutions are realized by advanced laboratory experiments at DTU and with our international collaborators at Cnam in Paris. Join us if you want to be at the research front within smart structural dynamics. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Responsibilities and qualifications</b>\n<br/>\n The project aims at creating new knowledge on digitalization of control and sensing of structural vibrations, with potential applications covering several engineering lengths scales - from acoustical problems in hearing aids to the overall dynamics of offshore wind turbines. The preferred applicant holds an MSc-degree in structural engineering with qualifications in vibrations &amp; dynamics, numerical modelling and experimental analysis. The project may include: <ul><li>Mathematical modelling of the dynamics of an elastic structure with piezoelectric or electromagnetic coupling to an electric shunt. </li>\n<li>Development of digital shunts that improve damping and/or sensing of structural vibrations. </li>\n<li>Experimental validation of the digital shunts by advanced dynamic laboratory tests. </li>\n<li>Implementation of wireless remote sensing and autonomous or adaptive structural damping. </li>\n<li>Development of digitalization in engineering research and education by participation in DTU's Digitalization Task Force. </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>We offer</b>\n<br/>\n DTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice. We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment.
