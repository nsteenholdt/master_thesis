Previously, this was only considered possible in metals through the excitation of plasmons, which unfortunately are associated with large optical losses. This new discovery opens tremendous possibilities for realizing a new regime of strong light-matter interaction, with important applications in quantum technologies as well as for integrating photonics and electronics. Enabled by a newly funded ERC grant as well as a major grant from the Danish National Research Foundation, a number of Departments at the Technical University of Denmark are joining forces in the Center for Nanophotonics (NanoPhoton) to explore this new research field of extreme dielectric confinement. <br/>\n<br/>\n We are now looking for up to three PhD students, who have excelled in their studies, to join our team, working towards new and highly ambitious research goals at the forefront of this new field. Our research addresses multiple areas and spans quantum optics, solid-state physics, nanotechnology, mathematical modelling, inverse design, integrated photonics, semiconductors, nanofabrication, and spectroscopy. See, e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01681 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06305 for our latest experimental breakthroughs, theoretical insights, and scientific background for the present positions. We aim to combine fundamental theory, device design, and our unrivalled capabilities in high-resolution silicon nanotechnology towards entering so far uncharted experimental regimes. The currently available projects include: <ul><li>Quantum nonlinearities. </li>\n<li>Optomechanical and Casimir interactions. </li>\n<li>Light emission from hot electrons. </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n The successful candidates will interact with a dedicated team of highly motivated researchers, where we emphasize strong interaction between experiment and theory, independent thinking, and team spirit. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Responsibilities and tasks</b>\n<br/>\n The details, responsibilities, and tasks of the PhD projects will be tailored to the qualifications and interests of the applicants but will revolve around the headlines above. Most importantly, we seek highly motivated and excellent students with an interest in teamwork at the highest international level. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Qualifications</b>\n<br/>\n Candidates should have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. Our research relies heavily on theory/numerical design, nanofabrication, and optical experiments and we expect the successful applicants to master at least one of these aspects but we welcome applications from students who have demonstrated excellent academic performance in adjacent fields. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Assessment</b>\n<br/>\n Candidates will be assessed by a panel consisting of Associate Professor Søren Stobbe and Professor Jesper Mørk. mailto:ssto@fotonik.dtu.dk mailto:jesm@fotonik.dtu.dk <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>We offer</b>\n<br/>\n DTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice. We offer a rewarding and challenging job in an international environment. We strive for academic excellence in an environment characterized by collegial respect and academic freedom tempered by responsibility. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Salary and appointment terms</b>\n<br/>\n The salary of PhD students in Denmark is high, with the approximate salary per year currently being DKK 382,000 (EURO 51,200) including pension. The appointment will be based on the collective agreement with the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations. The allowance will be agreed upon with the relevant union. The period of employment is 3 years. <br/>\n<br/>\n You can read more about career paths at DTU here. http://www.dtu.dk/english/about/job-and-career/working-at-dtu/career-paths <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Further information</b>\n<br/>\n Further information may be obtained by contacting Associate Professor Søren Stobbe. mailto:ssto@fotonik.dtu.dk <br/>\n<br/>\n You can read more about the NanoPhoton center here: https://nanophoton.dtu.dk/. <br/>\n<br/>\n If you are applying from abroad, you may find useful information on working in Denmark and at DTU at DTU - Moving to Denmark. https://www.dtu.dk/english/about/job-and-career/moving-to-denmark <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Application procedure</b>\n<br/>\n Your complete online application must be submitted no later than 10 May 2022 (Danish time).
