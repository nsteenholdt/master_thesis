In the respective groups of Assoc.

It could be around December 2022 plus/minus a few months.<br/>The duration of the employment is two years.<br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/><b><strong>Research area and project description</strong></b><br/><br/>Complex organic molecules, e.g. sugars and amino acids, discovered in interstellar space are believed to originate from reactions taking place at nanoscale dust grain catalysts. Primarily, these grains are made up of Mg- or Fe-rich silicates or carbon-based materials. In cold and dense gas clouds, the grains are increasingly covered with ices of molecules such as water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which may impact their reactivity.<br/>In this postdoc project, the successful applicant will develop and apply machine learning (ML) techniques to study aspects relevant to interstellar catalysis. This could be the structure and properties of interstellar dust grains or few-layer to bulk ices that may form on these grains. Or it could be the interaction of astrochemically relevant molecules with interstellar dust grains. For example, how the formation of ices may impact the adsorption, mobility and reactivity of small molecules that may be precursors to the synthesis of larger, more complex species including biologically relevant molecules such as sugars and amino acids. The ML methods could include approaches to accelerate structure optimization through surrogate models or ML force fields as well as approaches to accelerate the calculation of adsorption energies, diffusion and reaction barriers compared to computationally costly density functional theory calculations.<br/>The project will be physically anchored at the Center for Interstellar Catalysis at Aarhus University and will take place in close collaboration with partners carrying out theoretical work, laboratory experiments and astronomical observations.<br/><br/><b><br/><strong>Your </strong><strong>Profile</strong></b><br/><br/>&nbsp;Applicants must hold a PhD degree in physics, chemistry, nanoscience or equivalent.
