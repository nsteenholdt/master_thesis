The group is developing a new set of nano-scale devices for controlling and manipulating light-matter interaction in a quantum photonic integrated circuit. The activity will involve a combination of experimental optics, device simulation, and will be based in a well-equipped quantum optics lab at the NBI. The position will be part of the Center for Hybrid Quantum Neworks (Hy-Q, <a href=\"https://hy-q.nbi.ku.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">https://hy-q.nbi.ku.dk/</a>). The center is a collaboration between the quantum nanophotonics group and the groups of Prof. Anders Sørensen (<a href=\"http://www.tqo.dk/\">www.tqo.dk</a>) and Prof. Albert Schliesser (<a href=\"http://www.nbi.dk/~aschlies/research.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.nbi.dk/~aschlies/research.html</a>). In total the center employs approximately 50 scientists working on quantum networks.<br/><br/>  The successful candidate will be joining the ERC project NANOMEQ (<a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/949043\">https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/949043</a>) led by Assoc.Prof. Leonardo Midolo. The goal of the project will be to develop a new platform for photonic quantum information processing based on nano-opto-electro-mechanical systems (NOEMS) [1]. NBI has developed state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon sources [2] using semiconductor quantum dots integrated in photonic nanostructures [3]. To fully harness the potential of integrated photonic quantum technologies, it is necessary to scale it up, i.e. to perform operations on many photonic quantum bits (or ‘qubits’) simultaneously to generate and manipulate entangled photons. The overarching goal is to demonstrate the seamless integration of single-photon sources with the quantum gates required for building scalable quantum photonic micro-processors. In this project we will pursue a novel approach to control light-matter interaction and quantum gates based on electro- and opto-mechanical interactions. The emphasis of this project will be in the design and fabrication of robust nano-mechanical photonic devices such as routers [4] and phase shifters towards the demonstration of multi-mode unitary gates and scalable single-photon sources. <br/><br/>  We are looking for an ambitious and driven researcher with strong applied- and innovation-oriented mindset. The ideal candidate holds a Ph.D. in physics and has a strong background in quantum optics, photonics, semiconductors, and micro- or nano- electromechanical devices. Previous experience working in quantum optics laboratories and with cryogenic equipment is also required. The candidate should have experience in supervising students and<em> </em>a track record of publications in top peer-reviewed international journals.<br/><br/>  [1] L.
