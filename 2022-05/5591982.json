The position is a fixed-term full-time position for 3 years.<br/><br/><b>Department of Clinical Medicine</b><br/><br/>As a Postdoc at the Department of Clinical Medicine, you will be part of what is probably the largest health science research department in Denmark. Our clinical research covers all the medical specialties and takes place in close collaboration with the university hospital and the regional hospitals in the Central Denmark Region. We have approx. 30,000 square meters of modern research facilities for experimental surgery and medicine, animal facilities and also advanced scanners at our disposal. The department has overall responsibility for the Master's degree programs in medicine and in molecular medicine. At the department we are approx. 425 academic employees and the same number of PhD students cooperating across disciplines. As a Postdoc, you will be working at the Aarhus University Hospital. You can read more about the department <a href=\"https://clin.au.dk/\">here</a> and about the faculty <a href=\"http://health.au.dk/en/\">here</a>.<br/><br/><b>About the research project</b><br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to improve our knowledge in detecting the tumour shape on patient imaging such as CT, MRI, and PET, to make our treatments more accurate. To achieve this, we will look at patients that undergo tumour surgery, where we can correlate pathology data, such a histology and immunohistochemistry, with the patient imaging data. This is a challenging task, as pathology data is obtained after many tissue processing steps, and only on 2D microscopy slides. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a spectral microCT scanner to obtain 3D high-resolution scans of a tumour before it is processed for pathology evaluation. By correlating the pathology data with the microCT scans, we can develop tumour segmentation tools for the microCT scans, that will result in a high-resolution 3D representation of the tumour shape. This tumour shape can subsequently be registered to the pre-operative imaging data, providing a more solid gold standard tumour segmentation. In the final part of the project the more solid gold standard tumour segmentation will be used to improve deep-learning based tumour segmentation models for patient images. The spectral microCT scanner is based on a Medipix3 energy resolved photon counting detector.<br/>The selected candidate will be part of Associate Professor Jasper Nijkamp’s research group, in collaboration with the research group of Associate Professor and Consultant Pathologist Trine Tramm.<br/><br/><b>Your job responsibilities</b><br/><br/>As Postdoc in tumour imaging your position is primarily research-based but may also involve teaching assignments.
