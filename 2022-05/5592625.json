The main objective of this project is to develop an advanced insitu corrosion fatigue test facility in which a steel specimen is subject to mechanical cycling loading while fully immersed in an electrolyte mimicking offshore conditions. The system will be accommodated in an existing uniaxial servohydraulic test machine and capable of measuring the crack propagation under controlled frequency, electrolyte temperature, chemical composition and impressed electrical current from cathodic protection. The experimental results will be validated against test data from the literature. <br/>\n<br/>\n Your primary responsibilities and tasks will be to: <ul><li>Design the CF test cell in conjunction with the grip sealing setup, auxiliary support systems such as circulation pumps, cooling device and insitu crack length measurement system. </li>\n<li>Build and assemble the different components into a fully functional CF test setup </li>\n<li>Conduct insitu corrosion fatigue tests under different environmental- and load conditions such as force amplitude and frequency. </li>\n<li>Validate the insitu CF test data by comparison with other test data from the literature. </li>\n<li>Disseminate the test results in peer-reviewed top tier journals and conferences </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n As a formal qualification, you must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. Furthermore, strong English communication skills are essential. Applicants should be highly motivated, ambitious, and eager to seek and share knowledge, willing and able to work independently as well as in a team. <br/>\n<br/>\n More specifically, you should have the following qualifications: <ul><li>Strong background in mechanical engineering and profound knowledge in machine element design </li>\n<li>Good knowledge of mechanical material testing with emphasis on fatigue testing of metals </li>\n<li>Experience in corrosion theory and electrochemistry is an advantage </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU.
