The topic of this scholarship is persistence research and testing of UVCBs, which are Substances of Unknown or Variable composition, Complex reaction products or Biological materials. The specific focus is on developing and applying novel approaches for determining the biodegradation kinetics of essential oils in waste water treatment plants and the aquatic environment. The research combines elements of environmental engineering, environmental chemistry and analytical chemistry, and the overarching context is the environmental risk assessment of organic chemicals. The scholarship is a 3-year position and part of a larger project that is funded by the Research Institute of Fragrance Materials (https://rifm.org). <br/>\n<br/>\n Essential oils are UVCBs (Substance of Unknown or Variable composition, Complex reaction products or Biological materials) containing volatile and hydrophobic constituents. Essential oils are 'difficult to test &amp; assess substances' and they often fall outside the applicability domain of established tests, prediction models and assessment schemes. At DTU-Sustain, we have established an analytical research platform to study the biodegradation kinetics of volatile and hydrophobic test chemicals. We have recently applied this platform also to UVCBs including essential oils. However, more research on how to determine the persistency of an UVCB and its constituents is urgently needed. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Responsibilities and qualifications</b>\n<br/>\n You will be part of a research team that works on biodegradation kinetics of organic chemicals and mixtures at low environmentally relevant concentrations. The exact design of your PhD project will be developed and decided in collaboration with the main supervisor Professor Philipp Mayer from DTU Sustain. The position will also include teaching in bachelor and/ or master level courses, supervising student projects or performing other Duties at the Department. <br/>\n<br/>\n You will be responsible for:<br/>\n<ul><li>Developing, optimizing and applying test methodology to determine which UVCB constituents are degraded and which are persistent within a given time window and condition. </li>\n<li>Determining the presence of essential oil constituents in WWTP effluent and sludge, and determining their biodegradation kinetics. </li>\n<li>Contributing to teaching in environmental toxicology and chemistry at the Department. </li>\n<li>Publication of research findings and results in the scientific literature, and presentations at international conference/meetings in English </li>\n<li>Internal collaboration with other research teams at DTU Sustain and external collaboration with researchers, regulators and industries mainly in Europe and the US. </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU.
