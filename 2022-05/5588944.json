Working along the whole value chain our research activities cover organic, polymer based coating technologies from raw materials, over formulation, test and characterization to production and application. <br/>\n<br/>\n Overall, our research is focused on improving the sustainability profile of heavy duty coatings, reducing the use of unwanted substances, facilitating the use of renewable raw materials, improving formulation and test methods through the use of mathematical modelling - we also focus on the invention of totally new types of coatings technology with superior performance or functionality. <br/>\n<br/>\n Areas of our present research are e.g. anticorrosive coatings for steel structures, blade coatings for wind turbines, intumescent coatings for passive fire protection, fouling control coatings for ships and other constructions. <br/>\n<br/>\n All of the coatings mentioned above use pigments. They are not just crucial for the coating appearance but also performance, e.g., zinc in corrosion protection or copper in antifouling coatings.
