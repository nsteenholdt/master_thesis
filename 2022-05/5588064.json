The task is both technically and theoretically demanding and requires understanding of boundary layer processes and the technological and natural processes that govern GHG emissions and sequestration of atmospheric CO2. <br/>\n<br/>\n Academic training in one or more of the following fields, (bio) meteorology, physics, biogeochemistry, environmental sciences and engineering, and terrestrial ecology will be of great help. The technique that you will be using requires processing of larger data sets and programming, preferably in R. We will use advanced statistical modelling tools to evaluate the results. <br/>\n<br/>\n You will contribute to the construction, test and application of a new multiple gas, tall tower turbulent gas flux observation system for the main GHG, CO2, CH4 and N2O and other relevant indicator gasses based on the eddy covariance technology. The scientific novelty lies in the attribution of the measured fluxes to processes in the landscape and to identify GHG emission dynamics and hotspots and hot moments as well as CO2 sequestration sites and processes. We aim at providing scientific data to determine the actual GHG emissions, which will show in the long-term the success of the green transition towards sustainable development in Denmark. <br/>\n<br/>\n The project involves interaction with stakeholders and discussion of the role of GHG budgets for the green transition in Denmark. Basic knowledge of the Danish language is an advantage but not required. Professional English skills in speech and scientific writing are required. <br/>\n<br/>\n You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU.
