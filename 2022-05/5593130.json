The position is available from September 1st, 2022, or at a mutually agreed date. Very motivated and committed candidates with experience in cardiovascular physiology and animal models of human disease are invited to apply.<br/><br/>  The employment as PhD fellow is full time and for 3 years. The position is fully funded and is conditioned upon the applicant’s successful enrollment as a PhD student at the Graduate School at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen. This requires submission and acceptance of an application for the specific project formulated by the applicant.<br/><br/>   <br/><br/>  <strong>Project description</strong><br/><br/>  Heart failure is a critical, clinical diagnosis characterized by shortness of breath at rest, fatigue, weakness and edema. Two categories of heart failure exists: Heart failure with reduced or with preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF and HFpEF, respectively). A weakened heart muscle causes HFrEF, whereas HFpEF hearts are too stiff to be filled sufficiently during diastole. Historically, focus has been on HFrEF, but HFpEF represents an unmet medical need due to the unknown underlying causes, and the lack of efficient, clinical treatment options.<br/><br/>  The student will use an integrated approach – both cellular, intact organ and whole-animal experiments – to test novel treatment options for HFpEF. Ultrasound-based echocardiography can be applied to follow the development of heart failure in the individual animal. Isolated, beating hearts can be used to gauge the effect of changes in filling pressure. Histology tests fibrosis development and fluorescent dyes can be used to visualize the intracellular calcium handling in disaggregated cardiomyocytes.<br/><br/>  We are looking for an exceptional candidate with a flair for animal experiments.
