However, supervised learning is contingent on the availability of labeled data, i.e., each sample has a semantic annotation. The need for labeled data is a serious limitation to bio-medical applications at scale and complicates the maintenance of real-life neuroimaging systems. Here we will combine international open source data with local, high quality labeled data. <br/>\n<br/>\n The typical situation is that unlabeled data is abundant, and this has given rise to paradigms such as semi-supervised and self-supervised learning (SSL). Both directions in SSL are based on combining large amounts of unlabeled data with limited labeled data. While semi-supervised learning invokes generative models to learn representations that support learning with few labels, SSL is based on supervised learning with a supervisory signal derived from the data itself. <br/>\n<br/>\n This scholarship is funded by the Pioneer Centre for AI's collaboratory, Signals and Decoding. The Pioneer Centre for AI is located at the University of Copenhagen, with partners at Aarhus University, Aalborg University, The Technical University of Denmark, and the IT University of Copenhagen. There will be a cohort of PhD students starting during the fall of 2022 across the partner universities. PhD students at the Pioneer Centre for AI will have extraordinary access computing resources, to international researchers across many disciplines within computer sciences and other academic areas, as well as courses and events at the centre, and meaningful collaboration with industry, the public sector, and the start-up ecosystem.
