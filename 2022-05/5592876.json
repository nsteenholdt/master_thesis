This creates a very special environment, where we do not only conduct in-depth research on different theoretical and applied topics, but where different lines of research cross-fertilise each other and unexpected and exciting synergies often arise. Much of the activities of the group revolve around powerful algorithmic paradigms such as, e.g., Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, Gröbner basis computations, integer linear programming, and constraint programming. This leads to classical questions in computational complexity theory—though often with new, fascinating twists—but also involves work on designing and coding up clever algorithms that can exploit the power of such paradigms in practice.<br/><br/>  We are fortunate to be part of the Algorithms and Complexity Section at DIKU, which is world-leading in algorithms and complexity theory (currently ranked 6th worldwide by <a href=\"https://csrankings.org/\">CSrankings.org</a>) with a strong presence at top-tier TCS conferences like STOC, FOCS, and SODA and also with publications in premier AI venues like AAAI, IJCAI, and NeurIPS.
