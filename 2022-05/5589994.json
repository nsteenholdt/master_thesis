In total the center employs approximately 50 scientists working on hybrid quantum networks.<br/><br/>  The successful candidate will be joining the Innovation Fund Denmark’s FIRE-Q project. FIRE-Q is an international project between industry and academia involving three major Danish universities (University of Copenhagen, Technical University of Denmark, and Aarhus University) and four companies in photonic technology. FIRE-Q’s vision is to bring single-photon quantum technology to the market, enabling unbreakable secure communication and ultimately parallel quantum computing [1]. The key building block is a source of single photons [2] that can be transmitted over long distances in existing optical fiber networks. Following a modular approach, we will deliver the hardware required for photonic quantum computing in a scalable photonic platform. At NBI, we have developed a field-ready single-photon source at telecom wavelength using frequency conversion [3] together with industrial and academic partners. As a postdoc you will perform real-world field tests of quantum-secure communication protocols and develop new technology towards the realization of fully device-independent quantum key distribution systems [4].  <br/><br/>  We are looking for an ambitious and driven researcher with strong applied- and innovation-oriented mindset, with a keen interest in working in applied research. The ideal candidate holds a Ph.D. in physics or optical engineering and has a strong experimental background in the areas of quantum optics, quantum photonics, or semiconductor optics. Experience working with cryogenic equipment, as well as quantum key distribution are a plus. <br/><br/>  [1] R.
