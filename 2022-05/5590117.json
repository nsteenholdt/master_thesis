In that sense, our research focuses on these structures, their setup, how they function, how they influence the society and what processes, in turn, influence their change. CBS LAW also aims to exercise influence on regulation, through providing high quality legal and multidisciplinary research, participating in policy initiatives, and laying the groundwork for future changes.<br/><br/>Teaching responsibilities of the Department comprise undergraduate and graduate teaching.<br/><br/>CBS LAW is a constituent part of the Department for Management, Politics and Philosophy (MPP).<br/><br/><strong>Research area:</strong><br/>The complexity of a constantly transforming risk picture has challenged the static way of looking at law. One of the recent societal transformations is the way businesses and the public sector handle risk. Whereas a traditional picture of law is static, a modern view takes it as a dynamic entity. Risk, which is present in all business and societal activities - in finance, healthcare, data-based economy to name but a few – makes the legal baseline fluid and transformative, putting the question of risk-based regulation but also risk-based compliance at the forefront of business and academic interest.<br/><br/>Compliance, Risk Management and Legal Governance all refer to a set of approaches and tools used by corporations to embrace, employ and supervise a systems approach to business problems arising from risk. In an academic setting, Law &amp; Management is an emerging scholarly discipline but also a business approach that takes into consideration the <em>proactive</em> use of law by the management to deal with risk situations. Compliance refers to the process by which organization <em>polices its own behaviour</em> to ensure that it conforms with regulation. Governance, on the other hand, refers to the processes in which <em>decisions</em> relative to risk and compliance are made in an organization. The proposed PhD is based in a new discipline, named The Law of Governance, Risk Management and Compliance, which looks into how rules that ensure that organizations are effectively managed are formed.<br/><br/><strong>Examples of research areas that a scholarship might cover: </strong><ul><li>Compliance</li><li>Financial Compliance</li><li>Risk Management</li><li>Legal Governance</li></ul><br/>MPP provides critical and cutting-edge research in the humanities and social sciences.
