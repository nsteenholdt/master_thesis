REPLANTED is headed by senior scientist Claus Heiner Bang-Berthelsen, a large part of the research is conducted in a collaboration with a number of major industrial partners within food, ingredients and enzymes. <br/>\n<br/>\n The PhD project will be conducted at DTU National Food Institute primarily in the research group of Microbial Biotechnology and Biorefining, but also with collaboration with two other research groups: Gut, Microbes and Health and Analytical Food Chemistry. Additionally, an external stay will be included in the project. <br/>\n<br/>\n The research group Microbial Biotechnology and Biorefining is divided in different focus areas, that are working with dairy, brewing industry, fermented plant products as well as metabolic engineering. The area, that the PhD will be working in, aims to attain new knowledge on starter cultures using plant-derived lactic acid bacteria for plant-based dairy, focusing on removal of off-flavors and antinutrients by fermentation. <br/>\n<br/>\n One of the major trends, that will shape the food industry in the future, is non-dairy (vegan) alternatives to cow milk derived, protein rich products such as cheese, milk and yogurts. This is aimed to reduce the carbon footprint and provide sustainable food production where plant fermentations may provide health benefits, longer shelf life and safer products. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Responsibilities and qualifications</b>\n<br/>\n In the PhD a combined strain collection of almost 3.000 microbial strains will be explored. Candidate strains will be characterized based on various parameters. The following investigations will especially be in the pipeline: <ul><li>Carbohydrate utilization </li>\n<li>Pathogenicity </li>\n<li>Biotic and abiotic tolerances </li>\n<li>Metabolomics/analytical chemistry </li>\n<li>Flavor production and/or elimination </li>\n<li>Acidification </li>\n<li>Genomics </li>\n<li>Antinutrients removal </li>\n<li>NIR </li>\n<li>FTIR </li>\n<li>Prototyping of dairy alternatives </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n Additionally, the candidate will be involved in teaching as well as other activities such as general maintaining the laboratory, equipment as well as the strain collection. <br/>\n<br/>\n We are looking for a candidate with a solid background in more than one of the following areas apart from having experience with lactic acid bacteria and plant-based fermentations: <ul><li>MALDI-TOF biotyper </li>\n<li>Lactic acid bacterial biology and metabolism </li>\n<li>Isolation of lactic acid bacteria </li>\n<li>Droplet-based microfluidics </li>\n<li>Phenotype screening of lactic acid bacteria, preferably within plant antinutrients and/or off-flavours </li>\n<li>Enzyme assays, colorimetry assays </li>\n<li>HPLC </li>\n<li>Small-scale fermentation </li>\n<li>Plant physiology </li>\n<li>Biobanking </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n We expect that you are an efficient team worker, have good communication skills, and have a critical approach to the formulation and testing of hypotheses. In addition, we appreciate a good sense of humor. Written and spoken English is a prerequisite as there is teaching obligations during the project. <br/>\n<br/>\n Candidates should have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree. <br/>\n<br/>\n We additionally are looking for at for a candidate with a strong background in microbial biotechnology and food technology, having a strong knowledge within lactic acid bacterial biology and metabolism, as well as good understanding of droplet-based microfluidics technique and food and plant biochemistry. A candidate with some experience from academia and industry will be preferred. The candidate may have studied a MSc program in food technology, microbiology, biotechnology, and a BSc program in biotechnology is preferred. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Approval and Enrolment</b>\n<br/>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU. For information about our enrolment requirements and the general planning of the PhD study programme, please see DTU's rules for the PhD education. https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/PhD/Rules <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Assessment</b>\n<br/>\n The assessment of the applicants will be made by Senior scientist Claus Heiner Bang-Berthelsen DTU Food. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>We offer</b>\n<br/>\n DTU is a leading technical university globally recognized for the excellence of its research, education, innovation and scientific advice.
