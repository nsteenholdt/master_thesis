If you are interested in a combination of theoretical development with efficient implementations of the developed algorithms, then this PhD project on denoising diffusion variational autoencoders might be something for you. <br/>\n<br/>\n DTU Compute's Section for Cognitive Systems invites applications for a 3-year PhD position. <br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Description</b>\n<br/>\n Deep generative models are being applied to image, text and speech synthesis and are showing promise for molecule design for material science and drug discovery. State-of-the-art methodology for deep generative model use either auto-regressive, flow-based or latent variable models. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a deep latent variable model that has attracted a lot of attention. <br/>\n<br/>\n The denoising diffusion VAE uses a very simple diffusion model to encode the latent variables. Remarkably, this has led to robust scaling to very deep hierarchies with thousands of layers of latent variables and state-of-the-art performance in synthesis and density modelling. These results are very recent and there are ample possibilities for exploring generalizations that retain the robustness of the framework while making the model more flexible. This will be the topic of the PhD project. <br/>\n<br/>\n This scholarship is funded by the Pioneer Centre for AI's collaboratory for Learning Theory and Optimization. The Pioneer Centre for AI is located at the University of Copenhagen, with partners at Aarhus University, Aalborg University, The Technical University of Denmark, and the IT University of Copenhagen. There will be a cohort of PhD students starting during the fall of 2022 across the partner universities. PhD students at the Pioneer Centre for AI will have extraordinary access computing resources, to international researchers across many disciplines within computer sciences and other academic areas, as well as courses and events at the centre, and meaningful collaboration with industry, the public sector, and the start-up ecosystem.
