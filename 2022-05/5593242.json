We thus have access to a rich and varied data set that includes both safe and un-safe compounds. Matching whole-animal and ex vivo data against iPSC-based in vitro assays derived from the same species provides an appealing route toward validating organoid assays in general and thereby reduce and replace experimental animals.<br/><br/>  Our core goal to establish 3D bio-printed porcine and canine cardiac organoids on gel-coated MEAs is broken down into three key objectives:<br/><br/>  <ol> \t<li>Establish canine and porcine iPSCs and optimize a cardiomyocyte differentiation protocols.</li> \t<li>We will develop a procedure for 3D bio-printing anisotropic porcine and canine cardiac organoids directly onto gel-coated commercially available multiple electrode arrays (MEA) chips.</li> \t<li>We will apply MEA electrodes for electrically stimulating tissue contractions to accelerate maturation, and will optimize gel composition, mechanics and thickness for enabling long-term, contractile maturation.</li> \t<li>The MEAs are applied for quantitative assessment of tissue-level arrhythmic events in response to pharmaceutical treatments and results will be bench marked against results from native canine and porcine hearts.</li> </ol>  <strong>Principal supervisor </strong>is<strong> associate professor Kirstine Callø, Department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, UCPH </strong>E-mail<strong>, </strong><a href=\"mailto:kirstinec@sund.ku.dk\"><strong>KirstineC@sund.ku.dk</strong></a><strong> </strong> Direct Phone: 61666402.<br/><br/>  <strong>Start:                  </strong>1 September 2022<strong> </strong>or as soon as possible after<br/><br/>  <strong>Duration:            </strong>3 years as a PhD student<br/><br/>  <strong>Job description</strong><br/> Your key tasks as a PhD student at SUND are:<br/><br/>  <ul> \t<li >Carrying through an independent research project under supervision.</li> </ul>  <ul> \t<li >Completing PhD courses or other equivalent education corresponding to approximately 30 ECTS points.</li> \t<li >Participating in active research environments including a stay at another research team.</li> \t<li >Obtaining experience with teaching or other types of dissemination related to your PhD project</li> \t<li >Teaching and disseminating your knowledge.</li> \t<li >Writing a PhD thesis on the grounds of your project</li> </ul>  <strong>Key criteria for the assessment of applicants</strong><br/> Applicants must have qualifications corresponding to a master’s degree related to the subject area of the project, e.g. Biotechnology or Veterinarian science.
