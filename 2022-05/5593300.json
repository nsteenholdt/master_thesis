Our marketing is focused on people with a need, leading them to the product.</p>\n<p><strong>Lean &amp; data-driven:</strong> We try to get a deep understanding of the problems we&rsquo;re solving. But we also acknowledge that we often can&rsquo;t predict the outcome of our work. So we believe in an experiment-based approach to product development with short build-measure-learn cycles. For this reason, we also don&rsquo;t believe in detailed plans for more than 3 months ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-term &amp; compounding: </strong>We invest in things that will have a continuous return and compound. We e.g. prefer a 1% improvement of activation rate over a &euro;100k deal. We&rsquo;re self-funded, so we don&rsquo;t stress about the next funding round, and take the time to go into depth with our work.</p>\n<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>\n<p>A successful Driversnote is based on the people who make up our great team.
