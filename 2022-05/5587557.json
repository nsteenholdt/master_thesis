The position is available for 2 years.<br/> <br/> Mitigating climate change while securing livelihoods is a major societal challenge in the 21 st century. In this context, trees and shrubs (hereafter collectively referred to as trees) play a key role, as trees constitute a stable carbon sink while providing ecosystem services to the local population. Quantifying and monitoring the world’s trees is thus of highest importance, however, current assessments and statistics focus on trees within forests, overlooking trees outside forests. The extent of non-forest trees has thus never been systematically assessed at large scale, so it has never been possible to study their impact on biochemical cycles as well as their economic or ecological importance at large scales.<br/> <br/> This project builds on two revolutionary developments impacting on the field of remote sensing which allow the mapping and monitoring of individual trees outside forests in great details at a continental scale, introducing variables that go beyond woody cover and opening new perspectives for research in the context of ecosystem services. First, the massive increase in available data with petabytes of images recorded by satellites every year. Second, machine learning has been shown to deliver excellent results in the field of object segmentation in high resolution satellite images, as well as studying ecosystem patterns and dynamics in relation to climate change. The post doc will develop and work with continental scale data sets to study tree cover, vegetation and related variables in relation to climate change.<br/> <br/> The candidate must have proven to be able to work with large scale environmental datasets. Python programming skills are required.<br/> <br/> The postdoc’s duties will include research within the field of Remote Sensing as well as teaching. The post may also include performance of other duties.<br/> <br/> Your workplace will be the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management (IGN) within the Section for Geography. The department conducts research and education on the past, present and future physical, chemical and biological environments of the Earth and their interactions with societal and human systems to provide candidates and research in support of sustainable future solutions for society.
