Data comes in different formats and the different programs typically have to be carefully put into workflows where the output format from one method needs to be changed to the input format of downstream methods.

Data formats and standards exist in a chaotic tapestry, reflecting the diverse nature of experimental platforms and analytical tools. This heterogeneity necessitates laborious manual processing, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors.
