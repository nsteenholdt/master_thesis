However, there is still several possibilities to improve the efficiency by pre- and posttreatment of the substrates used.<br><br>The objectives are: (i) to identify and optimize cost-effective pre-treatment methods, evaluating their impact on gas yield and the removal of micropollutants, (ii) to develop an innovative digester design by implementing serial connections of digesters with optimized retention times and temperatures, (iii) to investigate the influence of applied pre-treatment on the formation of degradation products of micropollutants and their subsequent effects on the anaerobic digestion process.<br><br>The aims are to design innovative pre-treatment technologies for effluents containing micropollutants. The focus will be on efficient reactor configurations and process conditions to optimize the pre-treatment process, specifically targeting the breakdown of complex organic compounds.
