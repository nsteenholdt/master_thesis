In this PhD project, the successful candidate will investigate management strategies that enhance the utilization of P resources in soil (“legacy P”) and in biochar. These strategies encompass biochar placement and interactions with nitrogen fertilization, among other factors. An improved understanding of how P from soil and biochar can be effectively utilized by the crop will ensure the maintenance of crop productivity, while reducing dependence on mineral P fertilizers and achieving a more balanced P use with lower soil P accumulation.<br><br>The experimental work includes exploring management strategies under controlled conditions in climate chambers and carrying out experiments under field conditions to test the effectiveness of promising strategies. Phosphorus leaching studies will also be performed to study environmental effects of the proposed strategies. The successful candidate will be trained in and perform soil, water and plant analyses for this purpose.<br><br>This PhD study is funded by the projects “Improved utilization of P by positioned application and use of biochar - PiBalance” (GUDP, journal ID 34009-22-2061) and” Unlocking the soil phosphorus resources by targeted nitrogen fertilization: Understanding and exploiting the key mechanisms behind -uNlockP”, grant ID 10.46540/3105- 00051B, Research Fund Denmark).<br><br><strong>Project description:</strong> For technical reasons, you must upload a project description.
