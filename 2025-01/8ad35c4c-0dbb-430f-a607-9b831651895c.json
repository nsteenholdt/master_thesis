Recent assessments show that more than 50% of peatlands are degraded by drainage and used for agriculture, forestry and peat extraction. This results in a series of ecological problems, including declining biodiversity, soil subsidence, higher risk of wildfires, salt intrusion in coastal areas and greater risk of flooding. Furthermore, degraded peatlands release huge quantities of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. The EU is the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) from drained peatlands (230 Mt CO2eq/year = 15% of total global peatland emissions), despite accounting for less than 5% of the EU land area. In this regard, the restoration of peatlands and other associated ecosystems, as foreseen under the recently adopted Nature Restoration Regulation, has great potential both ecologically and for the EU’s climate targets.<br><br>The overall PhD project is also relevant to EU policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Land Use and Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), Biodiversity Strategy 2030, Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) and Soil Monitoring Law. Overall, this project will contribute to the implementation of the NRR, inform climate change mitigation policy, optimise land use management, and eventually provide a roadmap to more sustainable primary production systems. The outcomes will contribute to the knowledge base being developed by the JRC’s EU Soil Observatory and relevant policy areas addressing soil health and climate change under the European Green Transition.<br><br>The PhD student will<br>1. Improve the mapping of organic soils at both national scales and across the EU to assess policy scenarios for the sustainable management of peatlands.<br><br>2. Develop a scalable methodology to identify peatlands under different land cover conditions based on local data in Denmark, remote sensing systems and inputs from other sources (e.g. Greifswald Mire Centre, Wetlands International, Ireland EPA, LUKE, Soil Mission Projects, etc.).<br><br>3. Scale up the methodology at European scale using LUCAS topsoil survey, national inventories, COPERNICUS high resolution layers, and data from EU Member States, Soil Mission projects, Global Peatlands Initiative and bilateral contributions from other EU research institutes.<br><br>4. Develop a semi-empirical model to predict carbon dioxide and methane emissions reflecting changes in water table and soil properties through, remote sensing indices and new data and literature recently published on this topic. This semi-empirical model will compare its outputs with the emissions/removals from LULUCF inventories of Member States.<br><br>5. Model scenarios of peatland management taking into account the objectives of the Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) and other policies within the EU Green Deal (Nature Restoration Law, Soil Strategy, etc.). Finally, the candidate will look for the best management (e.g. rewetting) to minimise the emissions of carbon dioxide and methane considering climate change projections.<br><br>This project is an international collaboration between Aarhus University and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), with support from the Aarhus University Centre for Circular Bioeconomy (CBIO).
