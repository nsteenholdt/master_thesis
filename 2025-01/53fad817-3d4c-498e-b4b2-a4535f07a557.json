Technological advancements in sensor technology and data collection have significantly increased the volumes of data available for limnologists. At the same time, deep learning algorithms have revolutionized the sciences by their ability to extract information from data of complex systems. This sets up our conundrum: how can we, in a sound way, infer information from environmental data to update our scientific understanding and improve our model projections?<br><br>To tackle this challenge, this project aims to apply deep learning algorithms on high-frequency monitoring data for scientific discovery of, e.g., governing equations and driving factors. For this, the prospective PhD student will conduct field work and apply methods for data-driven discovery. Specifically, the candidate will:<br><br>(1) Support the deployment of additional high-frequency loggers at Lake Ravn, Denmark, and conduct regular microstructure profiler measurements of turbulent mixing and fluorescence at the lake. The data are essential to capture vertical turbulent fluxes, and the growth and decay of algae blooms inside the water column.<br><br>(2) Curate high-frequency data from global sources to increase data volumes. This will be done through international networks (e.g., Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network) and bottom-up data calls. Data will be quality-controlled and standardized to create a database of time-dynamic, depth-discrete water quality measurements.<br><br>(3) Apply exploratory machine learning techniques (e.g., Shapley values for sensitivity analysis, physics-informed neural networks for solving inverse problems, and sparse identification algorithms) on the high-frequency data set to discover underlying relationships. These projections will be compared to state-of-the-art vertical 1D aquatic ecosystem models to discuss their uncertainty.<br><br>This PhD project is part of ”Integrating AI into Aquatic Ecosystem Models to Decode Ecological Complexity”, funded by Villum Fonden, that aims to develop innovative mathematical models to improve our projections and understanding of non-linear aquatic ecosystem processes. The successful outcome of this project has the potential to pave the way for a new generation of cutting-edge technologies for ecological research, and to improve our conceptual understanding of two critical ecosystem processes: turbulent transport on the physical side, and algae dynamics on the ecological side. Improving our understanding of both will support future management efforts to mitigate the formation of harmful algae blooms. The selected PhD student will gain skills and knowledge in limnological field monitoring, data science, environmental fluid dynamics, phytoplankton ecology, and deep learning. The project will involve close work with colleagues at the Department of Ecoscience as well as active collaborations with scientific institutions in North America and Europe with the opportunity to undergo research stays.<br><br>In the Computational Limnology team at the Freshwater Ecology section at Aarhus University, we are focused on having a diverse, fair, and inclusive team and work environment.
