This approach will enable detailed assessment of global tree dynamics, including key functional and structural properties such as important species, the use of trees, tree horizontal and vertical structure, carbon stocks and carbon sequestration rates.<br><br>  This research paves the road towards addressing science questions on major unknowns within global change research. Here the center will break new grounds on how global warming and increased climatic extreme events affect tree physiology and growth patterns at species level and we will quantify the extent and dynamics of anthropogenic forest disturbance and degradation.<br><br>  Ultimately, this research enable us to uncover the potentials for various forest and tree-related production systems and human livelihoods as means of climate mitigation actions while improving our understanding of the importance of woody resources for sustainable food systems.<br><br>  The <strong>role of the PhD student</strong> will be to develop research techniques for improved assessment and monitoring of woody vegetation ecosystem properties at the level of single trees based on relevant remote sensing technology and AI algorithms, with a focus on disturbances and change dynamics. Specifically, the work will integrate both PlanetScope and Sentinel sensors using deep learning techniques. Our group has access to large amounts of PlanetScope data and has developed advanced methods for global-scale applications within environmental resource monitoring. However, the harnessing of model predictions by integrating freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, as well as available snapshots of sub-meter resolution images, represents an exciting research avenue towards improved tree monitoring capabilities in time and space. The topic is flexible, but may include (guided) super-resolution or other image sharpening techniques. <br><br>  The PhD scholarship includes an international research exchange stay and the potential for conducting fieldwork in relevant case areas. Research partners are LSCE in France and CREAF in Spain, as well as several Chinese universities.<br><br>  <strong>Principal supervisor</strong> is Associate Prof. Martin Brandt, mabr@ign.ku.dk Department of Geoscience and Natural Resource Management.

Fluency in spoken and written English is a requirement. As criteria for the assessment, emphasis will also be laid on Python programming skills and relevant experience in remote sensing and deep learning. Experience with handling and processing large image datasets and scientific publications are an advantage.
