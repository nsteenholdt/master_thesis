The position is within an university-industry collaboration project on optimizing chemistry applications on error-mitigated trapped ion-based quantum computers The goal is to test the developed quantum algorithms for the chosen use cases together with the error mitigation software of our industrial collaborators on trapped ion-based quantum computers of the industrial collaborator. A thorough understanding of correlated wave function quantum chemistry and quantum computing is essential, so the candidate should have a deep knowledge of the implementation of coupled cluster or multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) theory, knowledge of gate-based quantum computing on NISQ computers and be an experienced programmer. Significant research experience in quantum chemistry and quantum computing is required.
