You can submit your application via the link under 'how to apply'.<br><br><strong>Title</strong><br>High Arctic carbon dynamics, sink or source?<br><br><strong>Research area and project description</strong><br>The PhD project focuses on advancing our understanding of carbon dynamics in undisturbed high-arctic ecosystems at the Zackenberg Research Station, located in northeast Greenland. The primary objective is to analyse and interpret an extensive 25-year dataset from the Greenland Ecological Monitoring (GEM) and the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) Greenland ecosystem stations. The project aims to address research questions, such as determining the current carbon balance, identifying critical factors influencing shifts between carbon sink and source states, and projecting the long-term sustainability of these ecosystems under the impacts of climate change. This study will contribute valuable insights into the resilience and potential vulnerability of high-arctic ecosystems in the context of global climate goals.<br><br>The successful candidate will engage in data mining and analysis of long-term datasets from GEM and ICOS, combined with supplementary measurements as needed. The dataset includes comprehensive records of carbon flux, micrometeorological data, and ecosystem responses to climate variations in the high Arctic, providing a solid foundation for studying carbon dynamics in these unique environments. Fieldwork is expected to span 2-4 weeks during the field season (July to September) at the Zackenberg Research Station. Fieldwork responsibilities include setting up and maintaining advanced instrumentation, along with the opportunity to design and implement additional measurements that support an integrated carbon monitoring system. Through this project, the candidate will contribute meaningfully to the scientific understanding of high-arctic ecosystems in a changing climate.<br><br><strong>Project description: </strong>For technical reasons, you must upload a project description.
