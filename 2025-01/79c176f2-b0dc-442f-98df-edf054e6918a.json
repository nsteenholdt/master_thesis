The research in this section is multidisciplinary and you will enjoy the advantages of a creative and inspiring work environment.

The RPPs will be responsible for maintaining security of supply and stability of the power system in absence of conventional generators, coping with simultaneous, e.g. weather, market, and grid uncertainties. &nbsp; RPPs will provide extensive system services, e.g. frequency reserves, reactive power, voltage control, virtual inertia and black start. One concern is that using traditional linear controllers in RPPs in systems with multiple uncertainties might jeopardize both their own and the system small- and large-signal stability.&nbsp;Thus, the stability of future systems is highly dependent on their own operational conditions, RPPs’ control capabilities, and the interactions between the control layers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, you will develop an advanced control for RPPs providing grid services that is asymptotically stable in the presence of uncertainties. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will play a crucial role in the modeling and control of these RPPs, ensuring optimized performance and efficiency.</p>\n<p>You will be part of a joint alliance research project called <strong>Advanced control of renewable power plants for resiliency of highly uncertain power systems</strong>\n , where you will interact with researchers and experts from Technical University of Munich (TUM).

The strong co-operation between DTU and TUM, while requiring strong collaboration skills, allows you to accomplish the ambitious objectives of the project.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities and qualifications</strong>\n<br>\n During your PhD studies, you will develop advanced control methods for RPPs to ensure their stable grid services, thereby maintaining the security and stability of these complex environments. You are expected to thoroughly model the dynamics of highly uncertain power systems, identify uncertainties, and address interoperability challenges across various control and operational layers within RPPs and the power system. You will carry out theoretical derivations and analyses but also implement simulations to test the developed control methods.</p>\n<p>As part of your PhD studies, you will publish your work in reputed journals and present it at peer-reviewed scientific conferences.
