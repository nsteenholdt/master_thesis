With this model as a core experimental set-up, we investigate a range of features relevant for identification of host-microbe interactions explaining the persistence of the bacterial infections: Dispersal of the bacteria in the tissue model (confocal microscopy), responses to antibiotic treatment, metabolic profiling of the bacterial populations, impacts of host immune responses, biofilm properties of bacterial aggregates observed in the colonized tissue cultures, interactions between different bacteria in cases of multi-species infections, efficacy of novel antimicrobials, etc.<br><br>  <strong>In addition, you must</strong><br><br>  <ul> \t<li>enjoy working with complex topics</li> \t<li>be independent and have a problem-solving attitude</li> \t<li>thrive on collaboration/teamwork with a focus on the process as well as the outcome</li> \t<li>believe in dialogue and feedback as the best foundation for sound decision-making</li> </ul>  <strong>What we offer in return</strong><br> We offer an interesting and challenging job in an international cross-disciplinary atmosphere with the focus on research, education, innovation, and translation of basic science results to clinical applications for the benefit of patients.
