Phytoplankton monitoring is traditionally monitored using microscopy, a method that is time-consuming and prone to large human biases. Optical methods, such as pulse-shape recording flow cytometry and image-in-flow microscope, produce large amounts of data that can be used for fingerprinting plankton cells at relevant taxonomical resolution as well as potentially assessing their fitness. Automated analyses of such data will allow for higher throughput and thereby, greater insights into plankton community structures and the drivers of these as well as their role in marine food webs.<br><br>This project aims to develop statistical and/or artificial intelligence methods to analyse data from these new technologies and compare them with traditional plankton monitoring techniques. The project also aims at demonstrating how this information improves our understanding of the factors regulating plankton communities by combing data from these technologies with ancillary meteorological and water quality observations. Obtaining high-frequency data, unaffected by human biases, will improve our understanding of ecological interactions in the plankton community. Extensive data sets for exploring these new technologies have already been collected and preprocessed for this project, but establishing new data sets through experiments and intensive field sampling campaigns is also envisaged. The project will involve collaboration with other scientific institutions in Europe.<br><br>The successful outcome of this project has the potential to define the next generation of monitoring plankton communities, which will gain large interest from scientists and environmental agencies. The general applicability of developed methods is essential to the project and the developed methods should be made publicly available to the different stakeholders.<br><br><strong>Project description: </strong>For technical reasons, you must upload a project description.
