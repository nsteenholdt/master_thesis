The topic is design and construction methods for advanced light-weight timber shell structure. At core, the research is to explore the use of low strength timber in Scandinavia for advanced light-weight structures with enhanced material utilisation. Therefore, the research will investigate the impacts of 1) both sectional and global geometry, 2) material characteristics of wood, 3) construction methods on design performance.  The current research must adopt iterative design method, which involve theoretical, computational and empirical investigations.<br><br>  The research also comes with opportunities to collaborate with existing international partners in Europe and East Asia (South Korea, China and Japan), with strong track records of advanced timber and spatial structure research.<br><br>  The PhD will start on September 1st, 2025, and the application deadline is Sunday the 2nd of March 2025.<br><br>   <br><br>  <strong>General Project Summary</strong><br><br>  The countries with major economic powers continue to recognise both environmental and economic significance of timber as the building material. For timber to compete against other common materials such as steel and reinforced concrete, increased number of design and engineering research have been funded and developed in the recent decades. Among others, global researchers have placed concentrated efforts to increase the low strength of timber through advanced manufacturing of glue-laminated and/or cross-laminated timber (CLT), for example. <br><br>  However, the R&amp;Ds in advancing only the material strength have its limit on promoting the effective use of timber in greater scales. Therefore, further research is required in combination of advanced geometrical studies, in which the possible applications of engineered timbers are tested for larger scale advanced structures.    <br><br>  Light-weight spatial structures require careful balance of material strength, geometry, and economy.  The success and failure of spatial structures in the past have been closely governed by the designed geometry, and the role of geometry couldn’t be replaced by the greater material strength. The gaussian vault of Eladio Dieste as an example has the unique geometry to overcome excessive deflections and possible collapse due to buckling. The structure spanning 45m with only 130mm thick single layer brick could resist the applied loads due to the geometrically introduced stiffness.<br><br>  The current research is proposing to develop design and construction of geometrical strengthened timber structures. The research involves computer analysis based geometrical studies, followed by the exploration of advanced moulding and densification methods for timber to adopt complex geometries with increased strength and stiffness. <br><br>   <br><br>  <strong>PhD Focus</strong><br><br>  The current research has the following clear focus area:<br><br>  <ul> \t<li>Investigation into required advanced geometries with enhanced stiffness of low strength timber for light-weight spatial structures.</li> \t<li>Moulding and construction methods for such advanced geometries in timber.  This includes satisfying construction/production repeatability criteria within allowable precision.</li> \t<li>Applicability of local densification of low-strength wood for improved connection joints. </li> \t<li>Scalability of the design and construction methods.</li> </ul>   <br><br>  <strong>Applicant’s Eligibility </strong><br><br>  The candidate must hold an educational degree equivalent to a Danish master's desgree (180 ECTS/3 FTE BSc + 120 ECTS/2 FTE Msc) in fone of the fields below: <br><br>  <ul> \t<li>Architectural Technology</li> \t<li>Architectural Engineering</li> \t<li>Structural Engineering</li> \t<li>Architectural Design with focus on either timber or structural geometry</li> </ul>  The candidate will investigate into geometrical analysis of timber spatial structures.
