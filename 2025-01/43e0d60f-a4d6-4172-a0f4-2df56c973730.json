However, to secure a wide-scale global deployment of P2X processes, new and improved catalysts are required. Developing the next generation of P2X catalysts with more complex structures than the current generation requires an in-depth understanding and ultimately control of the catalyst itself and the fundamental reactions and processes occurring at the catalysts-electrolyte/gas interface. The successful candidate will be working on well-controlled depositions (e.g., by physical vapor deposition) and characterization of e.g. multi-metallic thin-film and nanoparticle alloys P2X reactions. Characterization will use e.g. XPS, ISS and TEM to probe dispersion and chemical state of the prepared catalyst materials. The candidate will also participate in developing a setup where catalysts can be synthesized, characterized and tested electrochemically without ever being exposed to air. The work will be in close collaboration with other CAPeX members who will provide computational screening studies for alloy composition and geometric structure.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Qualifications</strong>\n<br>\n The successful candidate will have obtained excellent grades in his/her Bachelor and Master educations.&nbsp;Candidates must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree, in Physics, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering or Materials Science by the time they commence the project.
