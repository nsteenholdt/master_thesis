Former studies in rodent models have compared different compositions of milk proteins, but it has not yet been mapped which dietary proteins particularly benefit bone growth and mode of action.

Further knowledge is therefore necessary to determine which specific protein sources that are particularly beneficial in terms of promoting bone health.<br><br>The present PhD project is anticipated to generate knowledge about how the optimized composition of dietary proteins can augment bone health through further developments of metabolomics applications in nutrition research.<br><br><strong>Project description: </strong>For technical reasons, you must upload a project description.
