We work on cell cultures, primary tissue from genetically modified mouse models and human donors. Using biochemical assays, live cell time lapse microscopy and in-situ perfusion, combined with <em>in vivo</em> experiments we explore how alpha cell function is regulated. <br><br>  <strong>Your job</strong><br><br>  We are looking for individuals interested in exploring alpha cell biology in the context of whole body phsyioilogy. As a PhD student you will participate in a project, in close collaboration with a Postdoc, where we will investigate kinase signaling in alpha cells. The aim of the project is to integrate the mechanisms that regulate glucagon secretion. As part of the project, you will directly work with the generation of viral constructs and use live cell FRET imaging to understand paracrine signaling in alpha cells. You will also participate in the maintenance of several colonies of genetically modified mice and design and perform <em>in vivo</em> experiments to understand the role of alpha cells in diabetes development.<br><br>  <strong>Profile</strong><br><br>  We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic researcher who, in addition to the desired expertise stated above, has the following skills and qualifications:<br><br>  Required qualifications:<br><br>  <ul> \t<li>MSc in cell in Biochemistry, biology or similar.</li> \t<li>Experience with live cell confocal microscopy</li> \t<li>Expertise in calcium imaging analysis</li> \t<li>Proven track record showing scientific productivity with at least pending publications in peer-reviewed journals.</li> \t<li>Proficient communication skills and ability to work in multi-disciplinary teams.</li> \t<li>Excellent English communication skills, both written and spoken.</li> </ul>   <br><br>  <strong>Principal supervisor </strong>is<strong> </strong>Jakob G Knudsen, Departments of biology, E-mail igknudsen@bio.ku.dk.<br><br>  <strong>The PhD programme </strong><br><br>  To be eligible for the PhD programme, you must have completed a degree programme, equivalent to a Danish master’s degree (180 ECTS/3 FTE BSc + 120 ECTS/2 FTE MSc) related to the subject area of the project, e.g. Biology, physiology or biochemistry.
