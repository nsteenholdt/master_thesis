Ideally, the successful candidate will possess excellent skills in with life-cell imaging, cloning, and molecular biology techniques.

To achieve this, we  use a combination of genetic, cell and molecular biology approaches.

We conduct curiosity-driven fundamental research with potential applicability to find solutions to create plants with enhanced productivity and tolerance to stress.<br><br>  The group is a part of Department of Biology, Section for Functional Genomics, Faculty of SCIENCE, University of Copenhagen.
