Initially, the work will be conducted at the new Preclinical Imaging Core Facility at SDU (https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/kliniskfysiologinuklearmedicin/picf). The Ph.D. candidate will work in a multidisciplinary environment with medical physicists, imaging scientists, clinicians, molecular biologists, and specialized staff at the animal facility.

OUH was among the first institutes worldwide to treat patients with a high-field MRI-linac and is currently a leading member of an international MRI-linac consortium. It is also the only hospital in Denmark to offer this treatment.</p>\n<p>The MRI-linac provides an unprecedented opportunity for daily image-based tailoring of radiotherapy. A new paradigm in this field is biological guided radiotherapy.</p>\n<p>This project aims to contribute to this paradigm shift in radiation therapy by developing an imaging biomarker for hypoxia, a local tissue condition associated with radio-resistance. We will utilize the unique infrastructure at the affiliating departments and propose a three-step approach to develop an MRI-based hypoxia biomarker, focusing on glioblastoma, a tumor known for its radio-resistance, with hypoxia as a key contributing factor: 1. Development of an MRI-based hypoxia biomarker in a glioblastoma small animal model using the new preclinical PET/MRI system. 2. Translation of the MRI-based hypoxia biomarker in patients with glioblastoma at OUH, using the clinical PET/MRI system to evaluate and optimize its reproducibility in the clinical setting. 3. Implementation of the developed hypoxia protocol in the radiation therapy setting by testing it in patients with glioblastoma on a 1.5 T MRI scanner for radiation therapy planning and on the MRI-linac system for adaptive therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n<p>The successful candidate will hold a master’s degree in physics, engineering, or related fields. Candidates with a master’s degree or certification in medical physics within radiation therapy or nuclear medicine will be considered to have a strong background. Prior knowledge of MRI or PET is not necessary but is an advantage.
