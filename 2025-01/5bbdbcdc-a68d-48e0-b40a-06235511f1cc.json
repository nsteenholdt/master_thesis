The programme includes the drafting of a PhD thesis, active participation in research networks, PhD courses, teaching, and other forms of knowledge dissemination. The PhD programme can be undertaken as a three-year full-time study within the framework of the 5+3 study programme, or as a four-year full-time study programme within the framework of the 4+4 study programme.   <br><br>  <strong>Duties and responsibilities</strong><br> Further information about the PhD study programme is available on the website of Copenhagen Graduate School of Social Sciences: <a href=\"https://samf.ku.dk/phd-skolen/english/\">https://samf.ku.dk/phd-skolen/english/</a>.<br><br>  Under \"Legal basis\" on the website you will find information about the rules and guidelines for the PhD programme and the Danish Ministerial Order on the PhD programme at the Universities. <br><br>  Information about the PhD study programme is also available on the PhD website of the Department of Sociology.

Applicants should check the study programmes for more detailed descriptions of the entry requirements. PhD students are paid a salary in accordance with the agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations (AC). The PhD student has a work obligation of up to 840 hours over the 3 year period of time without additional pay. The work obligation can include teaching, for instance.    <br><br>  <em>The 4+4 PhD study programme</em><br> Students who have completed a BSc plus 60 ECTS of an MSc degree programme would enrol as PhD students simultaneously with their enrolment in the MSc degree programme.

More specifically the PhD student will be paid two grant portions per month plus salary for work (teaching, presentations etc.) which totals a workload of at least 280 hours. Payment and conditions of employment are carried out in accordance with the agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Danish Confederation of Professional Associations (AC).
