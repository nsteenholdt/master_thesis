The successful candidate is expected to develop and derive economic values for the traits in the breeding goals, in collaboration with potato breeding company. This process may involve using various methodologies, such as accounting approaches, profit functions, or bio-economic models, to integrate biological and production parameters, market and non-market trait values, and industry feedback into both short- and long-term breeding strategies. The primary objective is to create a tool that plant breeders can use to calculate and apply breeding goals for various purposes. For instance, the tool may facilitate the development of selection indices for specific stages in the breeding cycle, or potato products for market segments and specific stakeholder requirements. Additionally, the candidate may analyze real-world data for genomic multi-trait selection, and use simulation models for breeding planning.
