Today, Aamanns has several different places, all working with the same gastronomic set of values and transforming the high quality that we’re known for from our smørrebrød into other dishes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The effort to revitalize and reinvent the smørrebrød has thrown much recognition our way. Both from the many happy regular guests, and also from Danish and international reviewers. For example, the restaurants Aamanns Etablissement and Aamanns 1921 have been recommended in Guide Michelin for many years. In 2019, we won the “smørrebrød of the Year” award from Danish Food Critics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Today Aamanns consists of the following</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aamanns Deli &amp; Takeaway (since 2006) &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Aamanns Etablissement, lunch restaurant (since 2009) &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Aamanns Frokostordning (since 2015) &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Aamanns Køkken &amp; Event, venue and canteen on Refshaleøen (since 2015) &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Aamanns 1921, restaurant (since 2017) &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Aamanns Replik at Skuespilhuset (since 2021) &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Aamanns GENBO, restaurant (since 2022) </li>\n<li>Aamanns Botanical Senses (soap series and lotion) &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Aamanns Kryddersnaps (snaps series) &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Aamanns cookbooks &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Ecology, animal welfare, and sustainability</strong></p>\n<p>Sustainability, animal welfare, and ecology have always been strong values for us, and all our businesses are based on these basic elements.
