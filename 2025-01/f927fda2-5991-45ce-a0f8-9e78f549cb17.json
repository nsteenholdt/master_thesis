The PhD position is planned to start from June 1, 2025 or as soon as possible after that, and the duration of the position is three years. The appointment will be at the Center for Energy Resources Engineering (CERE), Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark (DTU).&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n CERE is a leading research center in the areas of applied thermodynamics and energy as well as Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n With an excellent track record and international reputation, CERE uniquely combines strong competencies from several academic fields. Several of our many diverse research projects are conducted in collaboration or are of direct interest to with one or more members of the CERE Consortium – a group of about 20 leading companies in the field.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Responsibilities and qualifications</strong>\n<br>\n Water is an important but anomalous liquid, having more than 50 “anomalous properties” where no other liquids behave this way. Understanding the origin of these anomalous properties is crucial in all respects, also for engineering- The origin of the anomalous behavior may lie on water’s structure and hydrogen bonding and the dominant view is that water is largely a homogeneous, tetrahedral liquid. Modern thermodynamic theories, which account explictly for hydrogen bonding, cannot predict any of these anomalous properties and they predict much more hydrogen bonding than spectroscopy suggests. Efforts to improve the theories by including diverse phenomena such as polarity and co-operativity of hydrogen bonds have not been successful for the anomalous properties of water. The objective of this project is, by building on the recent two-state (TS) theory and our recent discoveries, to investigate whether the implementation of the TS theory can result in advanced thermodynamic models which can represent a wide range of anomalous properties of pure water and aqueous mixtures, including electrolyte solutions.<br>\n<br>\n You must have a two-year master's degree (120 ECTS points) or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree.<br>\n<br>\n A strong background in thermodynamics, mathematical modelling, and programming experience is essential.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Approval and Enrolment</strong>\n &nbsp;<br>\n The scholarship for the PhD degree is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in one of the general degree programmes at DTU.
