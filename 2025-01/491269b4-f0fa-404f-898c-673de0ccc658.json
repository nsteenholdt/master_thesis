Wetlands provide multifunctional benefits, including drought mitigation, carbon sequestration, habitat restoration, and enhanced ecosystem services. However, effective management and stewardship are essential for sustaining these contributions, requiring a deeper understanding of how interventions bring about ecological changes and shape future wetland dynamics.<br><br>The PhD candidate will investigate the ecological impacts of wetland restoration and management across seven showcase areas in Europe, with a particular focus on a subset of wetlands in Denmark. By combining historical and newly collected biological data, the research will evaluate biodiversity recovery, carbon sequestration, extinction risk reduction, and species colonization patterns under varied management scenarios. Fieldwork will play a central role, with biodiversity surveys focusing on plant and invertebrate species depending on relevance and candidate knowledge and interest (e.g., freshwater invertebrates, hoverflies, dragonflies, birds, plants, mosses, etc.).<br><br>The research can include:<br> <ul><li>Monitoring biodiversity indicators, including species diversity and abundance, to evaluate habitat quality and ecosystem benefits provided by wetlands.</li><li>Predicting biodiversity recovery under different wetland management strategies and validating these predictions through fieldwork.</li><li>Adapting existing monitoring protocols and employing advanced techniques like DNA barcoding to assess species diversity and abundance.</li><li>Comparing biodiversity outcomes across different successional stages of NBS.</li><li>Collaborating with local stakeholders to engage citizen scientists in monitoring efforts, ensuring the continuous recovery and long-term sustainability of NBS initiatives.</li></ul>This position offers the opportunity to contribute to a fast-growing field of research, combining practical fieldwork with advanced ecological analysis to create scalable, evidence-based solutions for wetland restoration and management.<br><br><strong>Project description (½-4 pages)</strong>.
