The BIB group offers a well-established platform for studying biofilm infections. We focus on the establishment of infecting biofilms, the cross-link between the host and infecting bacteria to improve diagnostics and treatment. The group conducts both basic and applied research on the molecular level as well as on a broader scale. The group consists of a broad variety of researchers with close collaboration to clinical departments. The position will be at the Department of Immunology and Microbiology, which is part of the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (SUND).<br/><br/>  <strong>Project description</strong><br/> The PhD position is part of a project funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation ‘Persistent Bacterial Infections (PERFECTION)’. The project involves collaboration between UCPH, DTU and Stanford University. Persistent bacterial infections are a serious global health problem, affecting a broad range of people with diabetes, obesity, smokers, immune-compromised conditions, implants etc. In the clinic, the number of patients with persistent infections is growing.<br/><br/>  This PhD project aims to generate knowledge of host-microbe interaction profiles in chronic wounds. In the project, wound samples collected from patients will be used for studying microbial and tissue transcriptomic profiles. The PhD candidate is expected to analyse sequencing data using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and perform microbiological experiments in the laboratory. We aim to answer basic biological questions about host-pathogen interactions as well as to identify potential infection biomarkers to improve diagnostics and/or treatment strategies. The project will be carried out in close collaboration with researchers working on patient sample collection and translational in vitro models.    <br/><br/>  <strong>Principal supervisor</strong> is Professor Thomas Bjarnsholt, Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Copenhagen, E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:tbjarnsholt@sund.ku.dk\">tbjarnsholt@sund.ku.dk</a> Direct phone +4520659888.<br/><br/>  <strong>Start:             </strong>1 September 2022 or as soon as possible hereafter<br/><br/>  <strong>Duration:       </strong>3 years as a PhD student<br/><br/>  <strong>Job description</strong><br/> Your key tasks as a PhD student at SUND are:<br/><br/>  <ul> \t<li>Carrying through an independent research project under supervision.</li> \t<li>Completing PhD courses or other equivalent education corresponding to approximately 30 ECTS points.</li> \t<li>Participating in active research environments including a stay at another research team.</li> \t<li>Obtaining experience with teaching or other types of dissemination related to your PhD project</li> \t<li>Teaching and disseminating your knowledge.</li> \t<li>Writing a PhD thesis on the grounds of your project.</li> </ul>  <strong>Key criteria for the assessment of applicants</strong><br/> Applicants must have qualifications corresponding to a master’s degree related to the subject area of the project, e.g., bioinformatics, mathematical modelling, computer science, statistics, biotechnology and/or biology.
