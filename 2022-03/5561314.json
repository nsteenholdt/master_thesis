Focus may be on food consumers, the food service sector or food retailing and the linkages to food production and processing. IFRO is searching for a professor who will take on a leading role with respect to research and teaching in this field.  The professor will be based within the Section of Consumption, Bioethics and Governance, which is a multidisciplinary section comprising economics, sociology, bioethics and law. The professor is expected to take a leading role in the consumer economics group and to collaborate with existing research groups at the Department of Food and Resource Economics as well as undertake interdisciplinary research in collaboration with research groups in relevant fields of natural science within e.g. agronomy, food science, human nutrition and health.<br/><br/>  We expect applicants to have an academic background within economics and documented empirical research competence of high international standard within economics and specifically within one or more of the below mentioned research fields:<br/><br/>  <ul> \t<li>Economic incentives related to food consumption</li> \t<li>Innovation and consumer value in the food system</li> \t<li>Economic linkages between food consumption and other stages of the food supply chain</li> </ul>  <br/> The professor is expected to maintain a significant record of publication at the highest level, to encourage research achievement and to nurture a research culture within the research group. Fund raising, external collaboration and active participation in research networks will be a specific priority for the professor in order to enhance and sustain the development of the research activities. The department will support the professor in this task. The professor is expected to disseminate his/her research to multiple stakeholders outside of the university (including policy makers, NGOs, and the industry).<br/><br/>  Applicants are required to have university level teaching experience, documented teaching competences and must be able to explain and reflect upon own teaching practice and portfolio. Formal pedagogical training or supervision equivalent to the University of Copenhagen teacher training programme for assistant professors is required.<br/><br/>  Duties include the applicant’s own research, development of the field, assessment tasks, grant applications, and research management such as supervision and training of research fellows and other staff. In addition, advisory work for the public authorities and outreach to society is expected. The successful applicant must also teach, supervise, prepare and participate in examinations, and fulfill other tasks requested by the Department. Finally, the professor will be expected to contribute to management and leadership through engagement with and participation in Department and Faculty governance structures. <br/><br/>  The Professor will be working in the consumer economics research group, which has until now focused on economic aspects of food consumption behavior in households and food service settings, healthy and/or sustainable eating, consumers’ perceptions and economic incentives concerning animal welfare or alternative technologies in agriculture and food production, and on economic interactions between consumers and other stages of the food supply chain. The group has a tradition for working in large multidisciplinary research projects and wants to develop a stronger focus on the roles of consumers in food systems. <br/><br/>  <strong>Assessment of applicants</strong> will primarily consider their level of documented, original scientific production at an international level, including contributions to developments in their field, as well as their documented teaching qualifications. Managerial and out-reach qualifications of applicants and their ability to attract external funding will also be considered.<br/><br/>  Six overall criteria apply for professor appointments at the University of Copenhagen. The six criteria (research, teaching, societal impact, organisational contribution, external funding and leadership) are considered a framework for an overall assessment of the candidates. Furthermore, each candidate must be assessed according to the specific requirements stated in the job advertisement.<br/> Please read more at <a href=\"https://jobportal.ku.dk/videnskabelige-stillinger/kriterier-for-videnskabelige-stillinger/dokumenter-til-meritering/5c_criteria_for_recognising_merit_-professors.pdf\">https://jobportal.ku.dk/videnskabelige-stillinger/kriterier-for-videnskabelige-stillinger/dokumenter-til-meritering/5c_Criteria_for_recognising_merit_-professors.pdf</a> .<br/> <br/> Further information on the Department is available at <a href=\"http://ifro.ku.dk/english\">http://ifro.ku.dk/english</a>.
