The next grand challenge — linking disease genetics to disease biology — has yet to be solved. Most GWAS associations involve non-coding variants that lie within gene regulatory elements — enhancers or promoters. However, a lack of precise tools for the accurate assessment of regulatory activities, especially for heterogeneous cell populations, has prevented progress in connecting genetic variants to their impacted gene regulatory processes. To address this challenge, we are 1) developing new assays and 2) computational frameworks to resolve gene regulatory activities in single cells and 3) apply these to map regulatory activities across cell types to investigate the mechanisms and cell-type specific effects of genetic variants. We are seeking a PhD student to join this effort, focusing on developing computational and statistical methods to model enhancer activity, enhancer-gene regulation, and cellular heterogeneity based on single cell data. Specific focus will be to integrate transcription initiation data into modeling of gene regulation and develop frameworks for enhancer-guided variant-to-function analysis.<br><br>  <strong>Who are we looking for?</strong><br> We are seeking a genuinely motivated individual with a MSc in Bioinformatics or Computational Biology, or a comparable field with extensive experience in the analyses of high-throughput sequencing data. Theoretical understanding in statistical modelling and practical experiences in the analyses of single-cell sequencing data are expected from the applicant. Importantly, the applicant should have a strong interest in gene regulation and variant-to-function analysis, and a desire to work on an interdisciplinary and highly collaborative project bridging single-cell genomics and genetics. Continuous scientific discussions and a strong dedication for ongoing research questions within the group also require proactive participation and enthusiasm for problem solving.<br><br>  In particular, we are looking for candidates with:<br><br>  <ul> \t<li>A MSc in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, or a related discipline with extensive experience in the analyses of high-throughput sequencing data</li> \t<li>Strong programming and data analytical skills</li> \t<li>Experience in genomics analyses and computational analyses of high-throughput sequencing data</li> \t<li>Strong programming and data analytical skills</li> \t<li>A high proficiency in spoken and written English</li> </ul>  <strong>Our group and research</strong><br> The lab of Robin Andersson focuses on modeling gene regulation with the ultimate aim to gain insights into molecular mechanisms by which enhancer or promoter dysregulation contributes to disease risk. We take an interdisciplinary approach and combine machine learning, statistical learning, genetics, and molecular biology to: 1) Determine which noncoding sequences act as enhancers, which genes they regulate, and in which cell types they are active; 2) Learn how the human genome encodes regulatory activity; and 3) Predict the impact of regulatory genetic variants.
