We are interested in everyday volunteering moralities, and – building on a prior project called Moving Data-Moving People – in the relationship between volunteering and credit. We will explore ‘green’ volunteering as one of several mechanisms of credit rectification and aim to better understand how ‘green’ volunteering is experienced and conceptualised by those who organise and take part in it.<br><br>  We approach green volunteering ethnographically and are interested in how people describe, collect information about, communicate, register, value, manage, and feel about it.
