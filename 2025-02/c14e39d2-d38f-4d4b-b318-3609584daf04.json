This entails new models for integrating choice and process data, new statistical inference procedures tailored to such models, and new methods for collecting rich behavioural data in immersive experiments. The project also includes substantial empirical work applying IMMERSION’s methodological innovations to real-world problems with implications for the human-centric design of future transport systems.
