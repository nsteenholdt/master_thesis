While this development can be expected to have significant potential benefits in rural areas, a large part of the population at risk of digital exclusion resides here.

The postdoc will, thus, explore emerging forms of active user engagement and address the role of technology, structural issues, and organizational implementation to identify pathways that enable inclusive user involvement. The postdoc will apply a range of qualitative methods (mainly observations of digital care interactions and in-depth interviews with older care recipients). Here, the postdoc will work closely together with PI Barbara Fersch, who is responsible for subproject 1 (emerging trust relations in digitalized care). To ensure that the perspective of older citizens is adequately considered in all phases of RuDiCare, a user panel will be established in the start of the project.
