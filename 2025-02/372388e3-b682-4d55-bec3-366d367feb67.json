The Denham group is focused on developing stem cell therapies for Parkinson’s disease. Specifically, the group works with human pluripotent stem cells, and they use genetic engineering methods to generate lineage-restricted stem cell lines, which generate dopaminergic neurons more efficiently. The group investigates how these cultures containing midbrain progenitors function in vitro and after transplantation in vivo. The purpose of the postdoc is to advance our current research towards a GMP-ready state and transplant cultures containing midbrain progenitor into a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease and evaluate behavioural recovery using standard behavioural tests and characterise the cellular phenotype and survival of the transplant using histochemical techniques and advanced microscopy. The in vivo aspects of the project are in close collaboration with the lab of Associate Prof. Marina Romero-Ramos, and thus, the candidate is expected to interact with her team.<br><br><b><strong>Your job responsibilities</strong></b><br><br>As a Postdoc your position is primarily research-based but may also involve teaching assignments.
