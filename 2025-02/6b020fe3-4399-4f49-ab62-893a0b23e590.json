This project aims to uncover molecular pathways regulating metabolic homeostasis using a CRISPR-based Perturb-seq system in transgenic animal models, where Cas9 is specifically expressed in reporter animals, enabling targeted gene perturbations in defined hypothalamic and hindbrain cell populations. This Perturb-seq system is currently being established in vivo, providing a strong foundation for immediate experimental work.<br><br>  This setup allows for single-cell resolution screening of gene expression networks, identifying molecular pathways through which obesity-associated genetic variants impact neuronal function and metabolic regulation. In addition to coupling perturbations to cellular phenotypes, the successfull applicant will integrate these approaches with circuit-level readouts, including neuronal activity measurements, and behavioral phenotyping through advanced rodent metabolic phenotyping techniques, both of which are implemented in core facilities at our center.<br><br>  The candidate will have access to state-of-the-art facilities and work within a collaborative, interdisciplinary research environment that integrates genetics, single-cell multiomics, and functional validation strategies. Our Center provides extensive opportunities for training and skill development in cutting-edge techniques, such as CRISPR-based Perturb-seq, fiber photometry, and advanced rodent metabolic phenotyping. Our group closely collaborates with Dr. Martin G. Myers (University of Michigan, USA) and Dr. Michael W. Schwartz (Washington University, USA), bringing together expertise in neuroendocrinology, metabolic regulation, and functional genomics to advance our understanding of obesity-associated mechanisms. Additionally, we work closely with researchers at the Broad Institute (Cambridge, USA) on the variant-to-function aspects of the project, leveraging cutting-edge genomic tools to functionally characterize obesity-associated genetic variants. The project will also involve interactions with leading international research groups specializing in molecular obesity and metabolic disease.<br><br>  <strong>Profile</strong><br> We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic scientist with the following competencies and experience:<br><br>  Desirable qualifications:<br><br>  <ul> \t<li>PhD in molecular biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, or a related field.</li> \t<li>Strong scientific track record (i.e., publications, training) relative to career stage.</li> \t<li>Experience with rodent models and in vivo metabolic phenotyping techniques.</li> \t<li>Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, preferably with experience in computational analysis of sequencing datasets.</li> \t<li>Experience with neuroscience techniques, such as fiber photometry or stereotactic injections, is advantageous but not required.</li> \t<li>Experience with viral vectors and genetic perturbation techniques is a plus.</li> \t<li>Familiarity with single-cell or multiomic techniques is preferred.</li> \t<li>A FELASA or equivalent certification for animal experimentation is desirable.</li> \t<li>Excellent English communication skills, both written and oral.</li> </ul>                                             <br><br>  <strong>Terms of Employment</strong><br> The employment as Postdoc is a full-time position for 3 years.
