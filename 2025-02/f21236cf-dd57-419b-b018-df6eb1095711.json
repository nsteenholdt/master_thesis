This is an interdisciplinary research centre committed to unlocking the vast, yet largely untapped research potential of ancient environmental genomics by enhancing key experimental and computational capabilities. The goal is to study community-wide and population-level processes on an unprecedented temporal and spatial scale to help resolve fundamental questions about the history of life on Earth.

However, studying these interactions holds significant technical challenges. Traditional methods struggle to provide direct, quantitative, and temporally resolved data due to the difficulty of observing or sampling living organisms and their remains. We aim to develop a new approach to reconstruct contemporary and past ecological interactions: direct stable isotope analysis of DNA fragments retrieved from environmental samples (<em>iso-eDNA</em>). This approach bridges, for the first time, three distinct fields—stable isotope geochemistry, environmental DNA, and ecological modelling—to enable the reconstruction of ecological interactions with unprecedented detail and scope, even in the absence of organisms or their remains. The approach has the potential to revolutionise our ability to predict and manage ecological processes important for biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation and food security.<br><br>  Your role will involve developing and implementing procedures to accurately capture environmental DNA fragments of taxonomic interest. These fragments will then be used for stable isotope analysis to track spatio-temporal variation in stable isotope signatures of target taxa. You will utilise and, where needed, modify advanced molecular biology techniques to capture DNA fragments with an unprecedented level of precision and purity. You will be part of a highly interdisciplinary research team spanning four academic institutions in Denmark, Finland and the UK.
