We have a strong focus on spatial transcriptomics and explore the functional role- and clinical potential of both coding and non-coding RNAs, including lncRNAs and circular RNAs, in pediatric brain tumors, colon cancer and hematological malignancies. Circular RNAs are extremely stable within our cells and carry out completely different functions relative to their linear cognates. To study these molecules, we use a combination of traditional molecular biology approaches and high-throughput technologies such as RNA-sequencing and NanoString CosMx technology.<br><br>To ensure that the group is at the forefront of translational cancer research, we collaborate with leading pediatricians, pathologists, oncologists and hematologists as well as basic researchers in Denmark and abroad.

By preserving the spatial information of RNA molecules in biological samples, this technology provides insights into gene activation or suppression in specific cells. It is invaluable for understanding complex biological processes and disease mechanisms, making it an essential tool for researchers in various fields.

Many non-coding RNA molecules possess strong gene-regulatory potential, yet the roles of most non-coding RNAs in cancer and other multifactorial diseases remain unclear. These projects aim to unravel the pathobiology of non-coding RNAs in cancer and elucidate novel genetic and epigenetic mechanisms behind aberrant RNA expression in cancer.
