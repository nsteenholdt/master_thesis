This project has a multidisciplinary nature and aims to investigate a novel approach to characterize mechanical properties of metallic and polymeric materials, including elastic and plastic properties and fracture toughness using micro scratching techniques. The goal of the project is to simultaneously measure a variety of mechanical properties by harnessing and analysing the extensive amount of information encoded in the scratch topography. The proposed approach exploits symbolic regression (an equation-based ML method) to establish physics-based, interpretable analytical models that express material properties in terms of topographical and dynamical features. As a part of the project, systematic collection and analysis of numerical and experimental data will be carried out. The project utilizes both numerical and experimental techniques, leveraging high-performance computing resources and state-of-the-art experimental facilities available at the AU Tribology Lab.<br><br>The project has received financial support from the Independent Research Fund Denmark (DFF, Danmarks Frie Forskningsfond).
